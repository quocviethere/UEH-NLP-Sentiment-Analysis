0,"2nd review now after 1st mysteriously disappeared. My feedback remains the same, this is a joke of a shopping platform where you can't redeem the gift for new user due to ""network error"" but no such issue with buying other items. Coupons for new user ends up in the invalid section on the same day when you sign up. Seriously if you can't afford the marketing budget to attract new user that's fine. Just don't over promise and under deliver... and stop deleting negative feedback.",0
1,"I wouldn't use this app again, at least for a long time until they catch up on both the technological and human performances. The pages load extremely slowly or cannot load, they don't integrate with foreign credit cards, and there are errors everywhere ( from shipping options to stock availability). The welcome gift disappeared after they collected my credentials and they still expect me to rate it! Furthermore, they really should train their sellers to be more friendly.",0
2,"The app gets very slow and unresponsive after a few clicks even after I attempt resolve by spamming the back button on my Galaxy S10. Issue is only resolved after closing the app completely from the app manager. However, this is only a temporary solution as the unresponsiveness keeps occurring. Please fix ASAP. Even after several updates, the issue is still present",0
3,"Disappointed over and over again. I have been chasing their customer service to help me add my phone number and address to my account. Imagine, a simple task of adding a phone number and address has gotten me frustrated. Why? Because neither their app nor their website allows me to enter a phone no. starting with the number 8. And the issue is still open.",0
4,"I purchased 2 fans but i received one product with the wrong product model and requested for an exchange. The help center say I don't have evidence even though I shown them the picture of the box with a different model from what I purchased. Another fan is making loud noise, but it can't be recorded as the fan of the wind interup the video recording. The help centre is not helpful. I'm going to uninstall after the dispute is over. Which I doubt that they will do anything.",0
5,"1. coins have expiry. fine. 2. limit use per day?! fine. 3. limit per item!! WT... ok. I am thinking of just use off my coins and stay away. But the stupid app is so slow and laggy. ok don't waste my time. differences against other platforms are usually less than a $1, sometimes more expensive in fact.",0
6,"Wanted to claim my free $5 free gift after my first purchase but couldn't claim at all as it stated either network error please check your connection or unknown error please try again. It's certainly a hoax, where got such good thing in this world? There's nothing wrong with my connection at all! I still can watch my Netflix in Ultra HD! I've been trying for 2 days already and the problem still exists! I tried again today and the claim page became blank, no items can be claimed!",0
7,You cannot track your payment history to match to your credit card payments. Purchase history is no good. Very disappointing that such a simple function is not available. App is buggy as well as it hangs occasionally.,0
8,Why do you make it soooooo difficult to choose between credit cards to pay or delete? And whats with the app not working unless we update proactively? Ie theres no notification msg to update leaving me with wasted time wondering why stuff doesnt work. Fire your UI team. They are incompetent. What a crappy user experience.,0
9,"So ANNOYED! I select items to cart out then the system unselects them when i try to apply vouchers. When i finally do that, the card I added beforehand disappeared & i have to readd it. Now vouchers fully claimed & promo for my card fully redeemed! App keeps freezing, i can't select anything or page remains blank. Set reminder for next round of vouchers to claim but notification appears immediately instead of correct time. Getting worse, now everything in cart is auto selected & cannot unselect!",0
10,"Place another order on 17 May via bank transfer, 18 May received a SMS say that the payment not verified and order been cancelled.... Check the app, indicated the order is pending shipment..... WTH...... Updated: I goes to the xxxx contact us page (tired both app and web page) . Fill in and upload the photo. But cant seems to find the ""send"" / ""submit"" button. What browser should I use?",0
11,The app has gotten very lag and loads contents (including account contents) very slowly. Sometimes it won't even load after clearing app storage and cache in the phone settings. Now it won't even login after uninstalling and reinstalling!!,0
12,Recently been having alot of lagging and payment problems with this app... Sometimes the screen will go super zoomed in that u only see 25% of the actual screen and u cant do anything about it. And whenever i tried to pay for my orders it always said payment failed.... Alr tried 4 times the same order and still the same result.. Its not my bank problem definitely i already checked....pls fix this asap,0
13,"Lousy Services... They suddenly prompted me if I pay using shopee pay. There's an additional 1000 shopee coins to earn. So after topped up, the pin page jammed and I couldn't checkout, and it dragged another day to troubleshoot. End up the 1000 coins wasn't credited and I lost my 15‰ shopee cashback as it expired!! :< and of all, their email replied was ""Pertaining to your query, please be advised that the cashback is only applicable for successful orders."" Byee Shopee I'm gonna delete you soon.",0
14,"This time, though we have clicked on ""Update"", it keeps coming back to ""Update"" instead of ""Open"". This error is repeatedly happening so we can't update Shopee.",0
15,"Used to love this app. However, with the recent update, the app auto logged me out, and now I cant sign back in. Before that, your receivable items cant be seen and sellers appear to be deleted for some reason.",0
16,"Not able to use my HSBC Visa Platinum Credit Card to make purchases. My Bank has checked, there is no issue with my credit card. They even issue a new card to me, but still not able to use.",0
17,"After update the screen resolution (page too big for mobile viewing) having issue when click into shopee, will be kicked out from app and need to re-launch app again. Also shopee customer support response is slow and sometime no response. Shopee Farm harvested item order was cancelled without refund or replacement.",0
18,Terrible. App became really slow after being updated. Many times it got stalled when i clicked it and suddenly the screen turned into an all white blank page. Really disappointed.,0
19,Misleading terms and conditions and terrible onboarding experience. Policies are horrible and the cust svc team do not understand user's frustrations. Extremely disappointing for a first time user.,0
20,I have no idea what's wrong with your app first I can't see my cart (keep getting error to retry later) thinking it was a bug I reinstalled now can't even login to see the status of my package 😡,0
21,Sad to see that the app is not able to operate at its optimum due to the possible overwhelming volume of users. Disappointed at the lags.,0
22,No paylah or paynow functions. Still using very ancient way of making bank transfer and verifying via screenshot which takes 3 days to process on shopee end. Concern about security.,0
23,Search Function - does not work. Keyed in words to find items but nothing close to it came out. I really find it odd.,0
24,"Slow loading and unresponsive. Buggy. Waited for long time to update software n fix the issue, started to feel impatient now.",0
25,Worst call centre template customer service ever. Don't bother to solve issues and either ask us to contact the seller to troubleshoot or ask us to wait and see if the problem will resolve by itself.. what a joke.,0
26,Same issue with another reviewer here. All images are too big and unable to view or scroll on the page. Fix your app,0
27,App is so lousy! Always lagging for no reasons. And the developer doesn't know how to clear the counter of inbox to zero .,0
28,"I liked the app before things changed. In my opinion, this app benefits buyers more than sellers as postage is free. Also, what I hate and find inefficient is that when items are put in the wrong category, they'd suspend it and notify you, but won't let you know which it should be in, so you'll have to guess and hope it's the one or it'd be suspended again or contact them and stuff, so I find it absolutely stupid and I don't see a point👎🏻",0
29,"Always stuck, need to exit and start back, lots of bugs issue.",0
30,"Please avoid using this platform especially if you are doing big purchases. I felt like being scammed by them. They gave huge shopee coins promotion but the validity of the coins are only a mere 2 months. During which, all other purchases to use these earned coins are limited in quantity. They do not allow the usage of all the coins one shot. They are not really an essentials only store where you can spend regularly. So end up the coins will just be forfeited. I lost $60 worth of coins.",0
31,Merchant can choose to back off the deal (including flash deals) anytime they wish to just by telling u some crappy excuses. Not that trustworthy app afterall. CSO can't give u an answer but to tell u to cancel and get your refund.,0
32,"More changes now that are disadvantageous to customers. I will certainly be keeping an eye out for new rivals who are better shopping platforms which think for customers more. The games don't work properly. I keep having issues. Like shopee catch no hat. Flip, found the mouse but didn't get any coin. The farm, no friends even though I allowed shopee app permission to contacts. So frustrating and disappointing.",0
33,"Terrible. The app is glitchy as hell. Caused a ruckus and made me look like an idiot for the mistake that their app made. Instead of assisting me, I had to fix the issue myself. And even so I cant do nothing about my parcel. Filed for dispute and Shopee refuses to refund me. Really, I was gonna get lots stuffs from your platform but looking at how the issue was handled, I would rather shop elsewhere. It isn't about the amount, it's the service provided.",0
34,"Keeps spamming push notifications on my phone about ads, seller promotion, etc even though I've uncheck those notifications in the app settings. I wanted to leave order updates and chat notifications on, but it looks like I have to turn off the entire notification setting, due to their broken setting selection. Very spammy, as I get 2 to 3 spam notifications from the app everyday. Please fix it",0
35,"Very poor service support, been using Shopee for few years but when there is issue, shopee kept quiet about it. Cannot use Amex card for payment at all. This issue have been there for months. Finally i could my Amex card, but payment still only show 1 Old citibank card which i had deleted. This is security issue. A deleted credit card data still in your system for payment. You have gotta to kidding everyone. How is that possible? And highly shown the poor banking security glitch.",0
36,"Terrible platform cannot apply promo properly. Contacted help centre they tell you sorry its unexpected but bank promo, they won't give u the discount even if its their platform did not apply automatically, seller promo cannot apply also tell you not their problem. So why run promo with partners if you wont honour?",0
37,Can't even find customer service to feedback when app is having issues. All just hid behind,0
38,Quite bad experience using this app. Especially for the first time user and welcome gift. Cannot redeem at all even though I am a new user. Will not recommend this app as there are other better shopping platforms available,0
39,"Please be wary of Shopee going forward. The recent promotions have clearly been designed for users to accumulate coin balances with cash, without informing them that the coins expires in a very short period of time. Very distasteful. Trust fundamentally broken here, and I'd imagine lots of consumers will move onto other platforms.",0
40,Can't play any games. Keep leading me to the game starting page.,0
41,Shopee farm hangs for 2 minutes. What a lousy server we get despite spending so much money on it wasting my time everyday with the farm,0
42,Why the image are not able to fit in one screen.,0
43,I'm using a Google pixel 3 and the app seems to keep bouncing back to the home page every time I do search. @shopee is there a solution to this problem?,0
44,"Been using the app since its launch where we spend hundreds to thousands yearly then met with an issue, emailed months back and the team still couldn't solve the issue, that's just sad man.",0
45,"So many random functionalities that the app lags like no body business. I just want to do my shopping yet can't even load the images and page. I'm on Samsung S10 and a 20mb/s WiFi. please improve your app, otherwise its so frustrating that I'd just visit Lazada instead",0
46,"Have updated the shopee app multiple times, however my shopee farm game continues to lag, in which I can't even load my game or water my plant or my friends' plants smoothly. Installed the most recent update and yet the game lags even more. Kindly assist/advise.",0
47,I have spent like $500 on their shops. Yet they remain unresponsive to my query on their app. Don't bother download if you think someday you might need their help on the app. Go look somewhere else where ypur spending is appreciated.,0
48,"there were many glitches in app, such as likes disappearing, items frequently being deleted. Most things I ordered also were spoilt or wrong item delivered (brooch). Some things were also cancelled by shopee, overall terrible user experience from the start, just stick with lazada though prices may be a bit higher.",0
49,Disappointed for local (home delivery) not improve the service. Now become downgrade the service. Local delivery more than a week to receive. (but shopee write local delivery will 1-3 working days). I have most of the times use this app to purchase my online items. Last time very good. But now the delivery is very bad. Local seller same day handover the item to (home delivery company) but I know don't why the delivery company keep more then 5 days in they store.If improved i will 5 star.,0
50,Really troublesome platform!! Not user friendly at all!!,0
51,Lousy apps. I was told to uninstall the apps again n again as I failed to verify number. And failed to add my card details. Tried so many times. Wasting my time!,0
52,Shopping cart seems to have problem. Click on shopping cart it doesn't show the item but hang. Please fix. Update: still having issue. Kindly fix it.,0
53,Somehow 'flipboard' ads shows the very same thing I've search in shopee app even though Ads personalization have been turned off. And shopee app is not in any way linked to my google acct.,0
54,The platform may be good but the vendors are irresponsible. They do not update that there will be delay or something in regards to the item ordered. Some vendors don't even response quickly.,0
55,Good apps but lousy logistics. Order an item from South Korea and China vendors. From China only about 1 week. From S.Korea from than 2 weeks also never get. 5 days in Spore warehouse still sorting. *^@%#&#^@#,0
56,"After update and before updates, there's more bugs and glitch. All my user interface are enlarged by 50%. How am i suppose to have a proper view of the products I'm going to purchase.",0
57,Very laggy and full of bugs. Shopee also restricted the scope of vouchers that were previously available for use on some products.,0
58,Too many push notices. Getting worst. It keeps requiring updating. Do something.,0
59,"Why every time i want to check my Chart, page hang? Last time don't have this problem. Without able to see my CHART, how am i suppose to make a purchase??",0
60,Seems like there is something wrong with the app. All images have been enlarged and unable to be reduced back to the normal size,0
61,So much buggy issues with games and search. Poor customer service. Poor seller rating. Poor delivery feedback system. Seriously it gotten worst.,0
62,When I use referral code it says invalid even if it a valid code and i am new user. Pls fix this,0

64,App keeps hanging after awhile and I need to kill it to get it responding again,0
65,I'm here in Philippines i been tried for so many times to fix my account!/ set my number I'm so disappointed to shopee. Don't waste your time to install this app,0
66,Didn't know the shopee coins will expired. Lost closed to 10 bucks because of this. Its ridiculous.,0
67,The notification sound is irritating!!,0
68,Worst shopping app compared to Qoo10 and Lazada. No quality control - some shops under Shopee Mall sell counterfeit items. Customer service is not helpful at all - replies are quick but mostly useless templates. Buy at your own risk.,0
69,Tried to buy 1 item but payment failed 3 times! Couldn't use my new user voucher although the payment failed.,0
70,"After the latest update, unable to play any of Shopee's mini games.",0
71,"Second update, still cannot play farm games.. dont understand why it cant open the games and asking to update..",0
72,Shopping within the app is VERY SLOW and it HANGS. I'm using android S10 plus up to date software.,0
73,"WORST APP EVER USED. They have Bank promos whereby you get $X off every, say Monday. However, my discount was applied but SUDDENTLY REMOVED FOR NO REASON. Shopee CS is basically stupid and idiotic, don't know how to provide solution. Slow in responding, randomly quit chats. Please DON'T GIVE ME A COPY PASTE RESPONSE...",0
74,Can't pay using credit card. It was ok prior to latest update,0
75,"After app updates, facing 10mins lagging delay for all clicks in shoppee. Please look into this",0

80,It always has an error when you try to add a credit card,0
81,"After purchase, history can't be viewed.. Worst online app ever!",0
82,Feed is too cluttered and sadly experienced a dishonest seller and Shopee did nothing for to resolve the issue.,0
83,Have problems loading after update.,0
84,"Full of fake vendors (purchase a product and suddenly it is out of stock, and they try to replace with a lower quality product, at same price of course). Also, Shopee cheats you with the deposit that cannot be refunded. When checking with the support team they told me that I just need to close my account and I'll get an email to get my deposit back. It's been 2 weeks I closed and no email. Shoppe simply robbed me 150$. Don't waste time with it, competitors are more serious and honest",0
85,Annoying faking app keep sending notifications every few hours in a day! Uninstalled.,0
86,04/05/2020 Unfortunate i bought a sale counterfeit goods. Seller selling counterfeit items with original ads and more put their sale counterfeit items on sale/first page yet shopee didnt do anything...... . I think aliexpress or qoo10 still better. Hope shopee settle my issue soon,0
87,Error on credit card payment. Rectify please.,0
88,"After using it for a month or two, am updating the stars for this portal. It's bad! Sellers are also always out of stock and they kept telling me to cancel my order. Looks like shoppee does not bother to vet their sellers. When I tried to contact shoppee via their ""contactus"" page, it will not submit. What a srewed up portal and customer contact page!!",0
89,The app keep lagging. Made shopping on this app very annoying.,0
90,"Having error after updating app, not able to load games page",0
91,"Lousy experience. The system did not register me as a new user when this is my first time using the app. Customer service gives standard response and did not offer solutions, and promotions are not as attractive as other competitors.",0
92,Going to uninstall this after I received my items. My card seems to be used for unauthorized purchase after shopping at Shoppee.,0
93,beginning Top-up 20% off still 20% off but when I'm purchases became only 10% off please fixing it,0
94,After updated I am unable to view my previous purchase..and also unable to make payment for my order,0
95,"Very disappointed. They changed the expiry period of their shopee coins from three to two months without notifying users. The coin balance in the app was also not updated to inform users of how much coins are expiring. There is a daily spending limit of the coins. By the time I discovered my coins were expiring, I have no chance to use it and a significant amount of my coins expired. Contacted them and they say there is nothing they can do about it. Felt so cheated.",0
96,"Need help. Im trying to go my shopping cart, but it hang. Tried to uninstall and install back again, still hang.. please help..",0
97,Bad experience. Didn't allow welcome gift after making first purchase. Ridiculous policy.,0
98,"Horrible and frustrating experience. As a buyer, items are taking so long (more than a week) to ship out from supposed endorsed ""Mall"" sellers. As a seller, listings keeps getting suspended for irrelevant reasons. Seems like the reviewers are just suspending items for fun.",0
99,"Keep getting ""unknown error"" signing up.",0

103,Why am i not being able to sign up despite following all the provided steps?,0
104,Took super long time to receive the parcel.,0
105,Why can't I log in? It keeps on loading,0
106,"Purchase at least 10 item . 6 out of item send wrongly. Send to seller no ref, ask for Shoppee no answer to it . I am a long time buyer in Q10 , total abt 100+ item I purchase zero shortfall. Actually not even one star, shield be negative. You load this apps for purchase, good luck to you.",0
107,"Hi, my screen always hang when I wanted to play the shopee game ""shopee farm"". It hang at the part where it ask me to ""click on water can to water the plant"". Please check and work on it. Thank you.",0
108,"Been quite slow lately, probably because many are using it?",0
109,"In this day and age of security breaches, it's shocking that there is no option to make purchases with credit/debit cards without saving it. So I tried saving a few cards but they were all rejected. Paid by bank transfer.. but there was a disclaimer that said 3 days is needed for verification.. when the merchants are threatening to cancel the order within a day if no payment received.. and also.. the app is clunky and slow compared to iOS version..",0
110,"Baiting consumers with offers but sellers not delivering on promised schedule. Then wait for refund, wasting our time!",0
111,Cant update my credit card payment method keep asking me to contact shopee support,0
112,Not nice at all. Been trying to get an item for past 1 week plus. 2 sellers never send on shipping dates and totally unresponsive. Total waste of time better to stick back to Amazon.,0

114,"Do not buy through this app, the promotions are a lie and the ""app-only coupons"" don't actually work. They will charge your card without applying the discount and customer support will refuse to honor the offer. Edit: In reply to the dev response, I have already done so prior to my review [Case Number 38371121] hence my statement about Customer Support.",0
115,"fix the bugs on android systems PLEASE the app is so laggy, can't even go back one page without the entire app freezing up. whats the whole point in spending so much on advertising when you cant even make the app usable for Android OS users? the iOS app is almost flawless and this app pales in comparison.",0
116,World class app that will cancel your orders without informing you. World class help desk operator drop the line after they are unable to answer your question. If you wants your order to be cancelled without notice and get no answer for your question please download this app.,0
117,"Unresponsive seller. Disappointing customer service & system! Order was not auto - cancelled by Shopee system despite seller failed to shipped out product. Despite putting up cancellation request, still have to wait for seller to acknowledge. Service lapsed by seller and customer service.",0
118,"Sorry to do this, but I have to say it's a bit weird for me that seller has 7 days to prepare for sending out goods:( I understand maybe they have to get the items ready, but the better way is to have good by hand and can send out goods ASAP right after the payment is confirmed! And I realized that I couldn't even reach online seller (first time user) and the service bot just really disappointed human beings! 3 days should be maximum for goods ready, otherwise don't put the goods on website.",0
119,"Horrible, shipped out item but cannot click ship at all because of technical issues. When are you going to solve otherwise we get penalty point because of late shipment . This is so dumb if you implement penalty point for late shipment jolly well make sure there's no technical error on your app to click on ship. This is such a simple thing to ensure of any shopping app.",0

Even when I use Web-based version of shopee vn, there is no English ver. HOWEVER, with LAZADA, I can switch from sg to vn, and fully in English. I have already bought hundreds of stuff via LAZADA thanks to their agile app. This is seriously stupid of Shopee in terms of strategy market reach.

122,Shopee Games are crashing!,0
123,Unable to sign up at all! OTP correct. Password correct. It kept redirecting you to Sign Up. Stupid app,0
124,You did not make it clear that you need to checkout the welcome gift with your first purchase. I found out too late when i already checkout my 1st purchase. Then your chat agent told me you can't make an exception and re-enable the option for me to claim my welcome gift. What kind of customer service is this?,0

129,"One of the sellers hotwind.sg, selling items from overseas which is not indicated on the info. Anything coming from overseas especially during this pandemic must be well noted by the seller and shopee. Did try to negotiate yo cancel/refund but shopee declined.

171,Online purchased items and paid. Mobile was not updated,0
172,Slow n choppy performance compared to iOS version.,0
173,Have to be careful for new scriber when you purchase something. Cause once you received an order you won't be able to reject or refund. This is very unacceptable to me which doesn't protect the buyer. Help center doesn't even respond after feedback.,0
174,"Encountered horrible sellers in this app who doesn't respond to any enquiries, have phone numbers that are not even active and without any valid business address. Looks like shopee need to improve its ecosystem of sellers otherwise it will be full of scam sellers who just waste your time and effort to chase them for updates on your orders. One thing you can improve: show how many percentage of items not shipped on time by sellers and how long is the average delay so customer know what to expect.",0

176,Too slow. Cant load many photos.,0

181,"Extremely disappointing. Signed up on 3 May 2020. Welcome gift couldn't be redeemed, fine. However, voucher for my first purchase also couldn't be used so I sought help. Shopee Live chat said they would escalate the issue but didn't get back. On 6 May, i wrote in again. Only on 19 May night was someone assigned to help. After i replied with the voucher error message, they said i am permanently limited because of 'activities' and this ban non-appealable. I didn't even do anything. Amazing.",0
182,The Merchants keep bugging you when you give them 1 star rating when the products are sub-standard. Pretty bad experience. Consider carefully when buying,0
183,Way too much expensive...uninstall,0
184,"Sucks la the app, the UI seriously damn dumb, what for have payment page when people not going to pay at 7-11 or cheers, the stupid payment page is just a scam so less people can use vouchers and coupon codes cos once you're in it, going back means your vouchers and coupon codes applied are gone already. Raise query, say will get back within 1 day but after 1 week already still no word from Shopee. Worse service ever. I deleted the app and once I receive all my items, I'm deleting my account.",0
185,"Sudden suspension of my account without heads up. All my voucher codes are still in my account and i have not used them, but i am unable to access my account now. Service centre is not helpful in retrieving my codes and just tell me account suspension is final. Very disappointed because i have been using shopee for so many years and this is how they treat their long term customer just because of some unusual activity their system detected and they do not even explain what is unusual.",0
186,I regretted update the new version.. Seriously very lagging.. No mood to shopping online with this type of service from shoppe HQ..!! It's already been lock down and we need to get things buy it online.. And this app after update to new version lagging and blank at all time.. Seriously make my days very bad days after days.. If you guys shoppe HQ updated your apps to a better version please do not let us having all these problems where we cant order things in shope.. We pay for our mobile data,0
187,Very bad user experience. Items comes in all scratched and damaged. Not only that the app forces you to return an item in 3 days by yourself through postal service if not they will cancel your request. Singapore postal service closes quite early. How am i surposed to return an item in a weekday? Cant even provide an extension to a saturday to return an item. Will never buy anything from here unless it's especially cheap. Rather spend that extra dollar on their competition app like lazada.,0
188,"I used to purchase items which gains my trust in buying, however products quality defects recently have a surge in rise. plus buying makes disappointment in what was advertise. moreover seller items are not very reliable when selling.

193,"Hello, i cant download This app please fix it",0
194,All items seems to be from China even if shop says domestic (sg) Delivery takes an average of 3 weeks to over 1 month. You give a rating for the seller that's 1 star and you wont get the shoppee coins. Not happy and probably wont purchase from shopee again.,0
195,"Did my first ever purchase with Shopee. Seller advertised 24hrs delivery, active 7 days a week. After making the first purchase, no news / updates till I questioned Shopee on 31 Mar (approx 6:30pm) and the answer was simply ""Will Ship by today or order will auto cancel on 4 Apr, refund back to actual card could take up to 14 Working Days"" Terrible customer experience. Update - Order was updated to ""Shipped"" after I ended the conversation at approx 6:45PM SG timing.",0

199,SCAM Shopee MY apps- I couldn't view items purchased after making payment in My Purchases folder and was prompted to download Shopee client to view the folder. Shopee client download was not successful either. My user account disappeared after 2 days. Closed and re-opened the apps and Shopee MY apps is missing from my hp. Terrible apps!

204,Harder to log in compared to the web version,0
205,"Horrible! I installed the app but my payment couldn't go through; bank deducted but shopee's server didn't work. I was given varied advices like wait 24 hours, try to make payment again and uninstall. I tried all but both promo code & 15% discount were taken away before I can pay. When I complained, the customer svc officers implied that I was uncooperative! Why should I waste my time further or risk a payment scam, when they took my entitlements? I asked to speak to manager; no one called.",0

Up till now I didn't receive the refund since I'd reported the refund in April and Mr. Jacob promised to put the refund into my account, but I didn't receive even I'd done as he said and not response me afterwards. Whats happened ? Please kindly let me know Asap!!!!",0
212,"They are getting from bad to worse. Siding with their unscrupulous seller to con buyer. I've asked for refund for a defective office chair. Seller said I am making false claim against him even with photo of the broken parts. That dumbo seller don't even know his product. Next I went to shopee to ask for a refund. After they asked for video proof and then with a long delay, finally they came back and asked me to return and produce the proof of return within 3 days during this CB period.",0
213,Cannot accept that shopee always automatically cancel my order.. Shopee's seller all just post photo only? product don't have then don't post lah!!!,0
214,"What a bad experience. Support staff Syifaa cut me off the chat halfway because she don't know how to resolve the matter. As seller, they make it confusing when buyer submits refund request so u end up losing your item and have to pay for refund. Their support staff will be polite and say sorry but tell u they can't help at all. Edit 21 Apr 2020: I got ended by agent named Iqbal abruptly again. Not sure why they have all these rude CS who can't solve any problems at all",0

When i chat with Live Agent, instead of checking 1st, they suggest i click refund. But i want the items! Said they will check, but no update few days later.

Also, the fact that there are so many deals/offers displayed in ONE page makes me SUPER overwhelmed by them...there are just too many choices to choose from and frankly speaking, I hate it. It makes me want to force quit the app sigh :( Hope you guys can do something about it. :'(",0
221,Not safe. Account got hacked and someone tried to use my credit card.,0
222,Impossible to plant anything other than coins nowadays. Previously it was much more easier,0
223,Please google (shopee seller scam before you decide to use this app) Be sure when you receive your item please don't confirm receive until you check. Onces press receive means no refund becuz payment will go to the seller. No matter what shopee will not protect you as you agree as received. 1. App problem 2. Customer service suck the q keep you waiting not like aliexpress 3. Even if Seller send damage goods to you they cant do anything for your refund.,0

227,Performance is just horrible on anything but the newest flagships. Sure there are some good deals to be had but you can get the same deals on a less frustrating app.,0
228,"Shopee Dispute agent is not so responsive. They don't value buyer feedback and in fact, they do not chat with us more in details to find out of our problems. Hence I feel the dispute service is not so effective if the seller is using fake description and playing with words. In the end buyer gotta accept the facts.",0
229,"Payment page is such a disaster. Full of verification processes, which results in errors and bugs. Wasted alot of time doing the verifications. The scary thing is that I have already input my credit card details for the purchase and then click the order button, which resulted in an error page. Not sure if my purchase has been confirmed and/or my credit card has been deducted. Alot of insecurities during this shopping platform.",0

I got an order on my store so I need to login. I also have money on my shopee wallet. Please help me ASAP.",0
234,App search is really buggy. Sometimes u enter and search the search page goes to another search page. And you have to keep tapping search if u want the item to be searched. Also back need press a number of times to reach front page cuz of this bug. Will re review this once this bug has been fixed.,0
235,"disappointing, and frustrating. for the Shopee Slice game, it allows users to use 2 coins to get another chance, however the app did not update my score and ranking every time i use 2 coins to play. I have been playing for at least more than 3 times already, and my ranking is all still the same. scam!",0
236,"Your referral program is not working. I tried 2 of my friends voucher and both didn't work and the online chat person was both unhelpful and can't explain why. I had to delete my account 3 times and reinstall but still it's not settled. Now I'm trying to make payment and even that doesn't WORK! The payment page just hangs and even after an hour of just letting it be, then says payment is not completed. Best of all, they wouldn't allow me to delete my account. Congrats you have hit the trifecta!",0

Update1: just tried logging in again just in time for the 9am shake but still unable to login in. Have already missed a few shakes since yesterday.. i am using samsung s7. Have tried to login on other phones as well. Impossible. Same error message I couldnt add things into the cart because it kept saying NETWORK ERROR. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER. So i thought it might be my phone's problem and i uninstalled and installed the app again but now i cant even login and it keeps saying the same thing! NETWORK ERROR. PMEASE TRY AGAIN LATER. And seems like i am not the only one facing this problem. The customer service is only available from mon-fri. So means there is no one to help us at all. How am i supposed to make my purchase later on??? So disappointed with the app! Please fix this before 12am for the 11.11 deals!,0
239,"When they send you an email to verify your email address, there's a big button that says YES but it actually also automatically signs you up for their newsletter. The link where you verify email address only without subscribing is a fine print in small font below the button. They have no instructions on unsubscribing. You can't even just log on the website to unsubscribe, as almost every other platform allows. You are forced to download their app to unsubscribe there. Deliberately misleading!",0

243,App Bug- unable to unfollow sellers who follow us. 1)Still not fixed after so long despite numerous feedback to customer service! In fact now more seller followers after they agree to fix bug! 2)App always hang+slow down esp if more items in cart. 3)Still can't allow us to copy & paste in app. whatever we type eg in review or etc except for improvement in being able to copy & paste order id(previously couldn't) from my numerous feedback.,0

I tested by sending it to my other laptop n hp and it was very clear!

Unclear photo. My order will be cancelled.",0

Just close your call centre, I don't see what benefit it provides. Qoo10 offer such a better service. This will be the first and last time I am purchasing on Shopee.

251,"The platform is notorious for sellers who post misleading ads and sending completely different items. It's a sellers take all platform. Refund is also laughable. It's clearly written that refunds are automatically processed after 3 days without response from the seller. Yet I have to continously follow up with CS. Frustatingly, only met with canned answers. I don't even think they look at my order details as they kept on giving steps which I've already done and mentioned those to them. 0 rating",0

Bought a marshall earpiece from their trusted Official Marshall Shop, the sound sucks so much which I paid at a high price. I bought it on May , now it's only July but broke already, it didnt get crushed or damaged externally as it has a hard cover. Looks like it was glued only and glue worn off. !@#$ you Shopee and your sellers.",0

It had been months and not my first time encountering this issue!!!",0
257,Couldn't even set up an account. The app needs massive improvements. I have given up and will just stick to Lazada and Amazon.,0

I install the apps, create account, search for item to get 20 dollars.. It state voucher being used, per device. I am have not even used the vouchers yet. This conned cust to shop with shopee. The cust svc has no product knowledge, one say system glitch, it will reset the next day, another say i used it on another device. If u want to give then give. Yr system cannot even detect if purchase has been made.... Waste me few days times......",0

Secondly, it doesnt show that certain item have purchase limit. it only pops up when you try to make payment.",0
264,NOT RECOMMEND! Bad experience with Dispute Resolution... does not help customer with disputes. I made a mistake to think that 'Buy 2 items for $25' to mean get 2 pieces at the price of $25. The item retails for $16; way over priced if only 1 piece at $25.99. Shopee condones sellers' over pricing and profiteering. How to trust such a platform with unscrupulous sellers. Shopee deleted my 1 star rating given to the seller!!!!! Will certainly be deleting Shopee!!!!!,0

288,Was very happy using Shopee than Q10 until encounter creditcard issue or bugs. Don't feel safe using it anymore for online purchase. The chat help can help or solve my issue too.😨,0
289,Failure to control the prices and allowing the retailers to inflate their prices during this COVID-19 situation shows a lack of ethics on both the retailers' and Shopee's end (also a lack of crisis management and proper planning). Will be waiting for Shopee to implement measures to protect the consumers from exploitation during this global pandemic before I decide to never purchase from Shopee ever again.,0
290,"Most likely theres a lot of bias working for shopee.My listed item been deleted for several times but others had no problem which they are selling same type of carbon fibre stickers like me.even when i make a report there's nothing they'BIAS' do.Come on all the bloddy bias,quit your job and go sell newspaper",0
291,Recently i received an order a mask( just $2 ) and the item received the ear loop break and asking for a refund but end up saying hsve to take a video of the packaging etc.... i had send 2 picture of the damage item and they still need video etc ...,0
292,It sucks becos the payment mode is so hard to access to pay. App requested for mobile number and said that its already in use and to key in a new number. Hows that possible? This is fruatrating as a user.,0
293,Horrible appts. Keep having error in payment. Customer only advised me to uninstall n reinstall the appts but still didnt solve issue. I dont have such problem in qo10 or ezbuy. So disappointing with this kind of service!,0
294,"Poor app. Each time I open the cart, all items get selected by default. It should either remeber the last selected items or not select any item at all!",0
295,lousy..the search function is not working. if it's not working then remove it so to save shopper time. I wanted to search for a specific items n cant use the function at all. will patrol back to qoo10 or lazada,0
296,Spent 30 mins and 5 tries to setup an account and made purchase successfully. Probably the worst ecommerce app I have ever tried..Pls put more time into fixing the system instead of doing a bunch of expensive marketing with celebrities,0
297,Terrible delivery ethics and dispute resolution by Shopee. Highly irresponsible delivery guy left my parcel in the water meter area without even sending me a message to inform me that the parcel was left there till I raise a request for refund because I did not receive the item though the app says item delivered. The worst thing is Shopee resolve the dispute without verifying if the item was found. Total disappointment with how Shopee handles such disputes! Total loss of confidence in Shopee!,0
298,I can't even login to my account. Tried to login through Facebook and SMS. It don't work.,0
299,after update keep saying network error when trying to add item to cart ... when my network is working fine ... other websites working fine ...,0

301,"was disappointed with my latest purchase where it was written 15 days return to ensure that our shopping experience is happy is nothing but a false hope with no further clarification with pictures to support customer's claim. just don't fall for its 15 days return policy claims, sure falls short compare to other online shopping apps",0

303,I can't even sign up .. using my # and google account ..,0
304,"No star given actually. Poor customer service. If you have a problem they will provide you with a default solution, anything more complicated will get ignored. Eg gave me a link that could not work, told them many times but no alternative solution provided. You just have to pay the price to be reminded again that online shopping isn`t friendly. Even if u get a price lower than the retail, you end up wasting more money if you are given a inferior or faulty product.",0
305,"Sooo, I can't add anything to the cart cos I don't have an account. That's fine. Tried to create account. Added all sorts of special characters and numbers to make the username unique. USERNAME TAKEN. Huh?! Uninstalled.",0

309,app keeps hanging at login page. no issues when I tried to log in with the same account and password via Google chrome.,0
310,"Horrible experience. Bought 3 items from same seller. Never received the items. Asked for refund. Shoppee so-called investigation finding: seller has proof that items are shipped. Pls check with neighbours or post box or use tracking number to check with delivery company. And without my consent, payment was released to seller. The buyer has no right on this platform. Horrible. Worst shopping app I ever used.",0
311,Shopee Agent failure in rendering assistance in my missing purchase... Dont try to bother to auto reply message here coz you guys simply dont bother to reply me before. So why bother... Thank you and have a pleasant day ahead...,0

313,Item ordered was not delivered and seller as well as Shopee could not locate the item and unable to resolve the issue.,0
314,Some sellers are scam and shopee can't do anything about it. Two seller block me after I bought and question their product..... there's a loop hole where seller can block response...... this is bad and shopee is just watching the show!

318,Infuriating garbage company that SPAMS the internet with their moronic poorly designed simplistic and annoying ads. Literally just a plague on the internet. They make the most obnoxious infuriating ads on YouTube that just irritate users on a daily basis.,0
319,dishonest platform.... 20% cash back coupon applied when make payment.. but after received only receive 50 coins instead of 1500 coins... customer service keep saying coupon not applied... ask for screen shot when make payment.... really fxxk up... who will screen shot when make payment.... think twice to buy again ba... good luck to u allllll,0

322,Payment problem. Saw a few reviews mentioned same thing but problem still persists. App is not easy to use. Bad.,0
323,The app has some kind of prob. It's like u can't collect the daily coins nor play the games. Dk how to fix it....,0
324,I hope the shopee management take note on those seller keep cancel the buyer order due to they cant shio out the item due to the selling price they disnt update and do they work on it. Is very irresponsible n unreliable. 200315UQRW4EXP aa for this paced twin order and wait for it end up just cancel without informing. Ask the seller only use the generate message to responce on it also don't even reply what you ask.,0
325,"Shopee is worst app that i used in recent times. They cheating us by giving not valid vouchers. They cover new customers by giving false promotion, but their welcome voucher also is not working. if we contact customer service, instead of solving issue, they keep on asking sorry for the issue and never solve the issue.",0
326,"Ordered shoes from a store (@supermallshow.sg) and shoes never delivered. Took him 2 weeks to cancel, so I lost my welcome coupon of $5. Return me my $5 and I will change my rating.",0

I have ever met that item was buy 30 dollar in the seller shop, the seller to me that item was different from their own display photo and item price look like 3 dollar. This application management attitude is poor. Better buy at Taobao ori apps, more quality assurance and refund.",0
328,this apps country selection is unuseful! either you select apps malaysia to install when you at singapore . end up it itself install singapore for you!!! cant change country in own account Setting also!!!! so Very poor!!!!,0

350,"Hated the notification alert, too sudden and too loud, very irritating.",0
351,Avoid buying things from shopee. I have already reported the app to google for being a fraud. Items bought were never shipped by the sellers and shopee is not doing anything to stop these scammers. Lets report the app to get it removed from the playstore. I dont understand how the app can be rated 4.8 out of 5. Even shopee cant even help me get my money back. Ill be making a police report also.,0
352,"All Shopee knows how to do is pay lip service and say sorry to the buyers and continue to let the seller's scam people on its platform. If u shop here, you're on your own. It's not worth buying any big ticket items off them. Avoid this app at all costs",0

384,"The ads on YouTube are very annoying, and I mean very annoying. I'm shopping somewhere else",0
385,Very bad shopping platform. Many scammer sellers have found a loop hole on the shipment days. They will indicate items are shipped but in fact did not. There is no way for buyers to make a dispute once the max shipment days have reached. Especially for shipments through normal mail and no tracking is available. I am one such buyer who got scammed. Latest update: shoppee has helped me to get back my money from the fraud seller. I am pleased that shoppee had listened and help to investigate the matter to make this app a better platform for shopping. Thanks!,0

389,Not worth risking your money to purchase items from this app. The after service in handling disputes are absolutely horrendous. They will side the sellers to reject return / refund request even when evidence is provided to proof that the item received is defective. Would give 0 star if able.,0

404,lousy stupid cancellation system very lousy app...waste my money and cheat empowers seller and buyer can't cancel within 1 day help chat is even worse and unhelpful,0
405,very bad support for damaged product...compared to other online apps...been using Lazada for years now even for high priced products and happy with the service...I found few products much cheaper but it negates how they support the buyer for bad products...just waiting for my refund and thinking of deleting my account...I would like say give positive feedback but none for now....I have few deliveries and its good,0
406,"Tried my first purchase on 21/10/19 was rather disappointing experience.

429,Customer service cannot handle customer needs. Need a lot of improvement. There are some bugs in your carts that at times cannot even redeem the 10% cashback as stated.,0
430,Please buy with caution. Refund process for items not received is tedious and they protect the sellers more than the buyers.,0
431,"Don't rush to pay the sellers, check your items thoroughly before releasing payment. Shopee doesn't really reply to your problems after payment is released.",0

After providing all proof they needed from the initial point of contact, they have for the 5th time asked for the same information.

473,Hated the way shopee would just release the money after a certain period to seller even without buyer receiving the items yet as I have to constantly check if the items have reached the add plus an incident whn I bought from a seller but the seller didn't disclore full details and in the end it couldn't be used..went to email to shopee but they just ask me to ask the seller myself and without checking on any progress shopee just close the case aftr some time..srsly cld improve alot on cust serv,0
474,Goods not received but have to pay for it. What app is this? BUY AT YR OWN RISK.,0
475,"Be very careful when you use this platform. Many unethical sellers. Some sellers make you wait for a few weeks without telling you that they are not sending the products. Some will include some defective ones when you order many pieces and it's difficult to ask for refund since it's not exactly damaged. Even at check out, sometimes the platform doesn't allow you to use certain promos or discounts which you agreed with sellers.",0
476,App is laggy. Cant even use properly,0
477,Unable to spin. App just hang there,0

481,"I am a victim of a unscrupulous seller. Shopee keep on saying I'm protected under the buyer insurance but Shopee is only paying lip services to buyer! Shopee has zero buyer protection and be warn that ""DO NOT BUY FROM SHOPEE""! Like what other users had reviewed on Google Map, Shopee does not allow cancellation even when the merchant had not shipped out the items. Shopee is enabling and abetting scam sellers. Am considering legal actions against Shopee as they frequently ignore consumer rights",0
482,Order receiving date is 05/10/18 but still never received. No proper information received from them. Very poor service.,0
483,I wouldnt use shopee ever again. Ordered a boot mat for my car got sent a roll of sticky tape. It took forever to get the refund and now I want to delete my account they are telling me I have a shipment sent to me waiting for payment. If they actually look they will see I have no orders and the one shipment I was sent that was wrong has been refunded. All I want is to delete the account. My advice DO NOT USE SHOPEE!!!!!,0
484,Super annoying push notification.,0
485,Lousy app... forever unable to log in.,0

488,"Shopee is a platform that does not give a damn about customer experience. It works well until you need to request a refund, then they go to extreme lengths to give you the run around. I was promised a refund to my wallet on the 18th of Dec but it's 7 Jan now with no refund to be seen. Went through 6-7 different customer agents who give no care about the customer, always ending the chat prematurely. The latest one told me I need to upload my NRIC to their new wallet to get the refund. Hello PDPA?",0
489,Lagging.. Lagging.. Lagging,0
490,Very disappointed with Shopee. They cancelled my order automatically claiming that the seller did not ship within the agreed time frame. And without informing me in advance. The seller already called to inform me they are shipping the next day. Shopee keep telling me that there is nothing they can do bcos it is due to system and advise me to order again (but the product is out of stock now).,0
491,Shopping page is blank,0

493,"Terrible. The service you provide is from good to worst. If your seller can't operate properly liked send out their items on a timely manner, I suggest u should find out why , let us cancel order with no demand and tell them to close shop.

494,Some sellers are unreliable.I didn't get my parcel but the seller didn't response. Terrible!!,0
495,"DISGUSTING shopping experience at Shopee SG. Received wrong items from same seller twice, raised a return/refund request as the seller insisted that I need to send the items back to Shopee office. Sought help from Shopee CS, pacified me by saying they will help me resolve this, end up the verdict is the same (go to SingPost, label etc. and go through all the hassle to send the items back to their office). Buyers beware, they will side their sellers regardless whose fault it was. Buyers beware.",0
496,I have encountered several dubious shady sellers since I started on Shopee about 1+ months ago. These sellers give Shopee a bad name. 1st seller sent me a message claiming the item is out of stock but I noticed it is still available but at a higher price! 2nd seller also claim another product is out of stock but the item continues to be put up for sale on Shopee. Also 'big thick bath towel' turned out to be only a small thin face towel. Many of Shopee's sellers are unreliable.,0

499,Crappy app login issues pretty much pointless,0
500,"Shopee should review all their merchants if they are genuine or out for a scam. Placed order for an item but when contacted seller, was informed item was not available via ninja van delivery and have to cancel and re-order. On second purchase for same item using their preferred delivery, was told and told to accept a different product due to they dont have the stock. So twice I was charged on my credit card and have to wait for shopee to refund from 7 to 14 days. Another total was charged!",0
501,"I need the Philippines price,not dollar",0
502,The system sucks. They should take a page out of Amazon where they only deduct payment after item is shipped. This gives the buyer time to reconsider and cancel his order. Sadly they will hold your $ and the seller might take 4 weeks just to ship your item and your $ is stucked. Would never buy anything using Shopee anymore. ADDITIONAL NOTE: Shopee requires you to handle your own returns. Unlike Lazada which provides returning services. Another good reason not to use this app :),0
503,"Some seller just disappear without informing.cancelled order got rejected.no refund, no nothing. Chat with their service agent representative and they got no idea how to help me.",0
504,"Shopee is a biased platform whom sides sellers more than buyers. These words came from Shopee CSR themselves that Sellers are able to delete ratings from buyers without consent from buyers. Hence, it is impossible to know if sellers on the platform are reputable or not even based on the ratings as dishonest sellers are able to remove the 'bad' ratings from buyers, to 'look good'. Not recommending this unfair platform to any others!",0
505,"Extremely poor chat agent attitude and unsatisfactory customer service hotline support. Chat agent Nurul disappeared halfway thru the chat & when i was unfortunate enough to encounter her again after starting a new chat, she used the same tactic of keeping mum. However, after i asked, she wasted no time in giving me a hotline number which i soon found could not be put thru even after hanging on for almost 10 mins Btw,, my problem started with repeated server error when trying to pay by visa",0

514,"Shopee released payment to seller for a defective item. Raised a dispute and the ""relevant department"" just kept asking me to send video and photo.

517,"My first impression: Shopee is a bunch of very SNEAKY people. I signed up online and they sent me email to verify acct. There's a big banner that says ""Yes pls"", in the email, to receiving ads from them, and I mistakenly clicked on it to verify account. After that, I couldn't find any settings to turn off ads from them. I have not started using your site and have already wasted so much of my time. What a BLOODY SNEAKY way to sign up users. This company have no basic respect for its customers",0
518,my first time trying to buy things on Shopee. the app is good but I can't say the same for the sellers I'm dealing with. Both times I have bad experience with 2 different sellers. First product came broken and the second one didn't ship out my item after a week despite telling me they'll ship out several times. It's the kind of quality of the sellers/products for cheap prices.

Shopee sg are cheaters tell me that since i have not claimed my welcome pack as my 1st purchase i am not entitled to my welcome pack.

And Shopee does not help much. They will asked you to email/call/ explain/ sent photos to Shopee , investigate further n etc. which frankly speaking, it does not help.

If you know you are expecting huge server traffic for 9.9, why so many issues? Judging from the other reviews, I'm not the only frustrated user. This experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be using your app any time soon.",0
863,"Disappointing that shopee does not take action against dishonourable sellers who cancel the buyers's orders citing ""out of stock"" and changing the price instantly. Has happened twice to me this year and shopee does not take action despite the user reporting. Have decided to boycott this app till the team actually protects buyers more.",0
864,Lol try to add to cart cannot... miss my 9.9 deal.. this app cannot make it. Even if you add back missed deals.. sold out how?? Fail.. will not buy from here.. not trusted!!,0

871,"I used to love Shopee a lot as my main online shopping app. However the recent 9/9 sales has proven that Shopee is not capable of handling the surge in the influx of buyers within this period. Was extremely disappointed when I have missed a couple of flash deals because of the network issues. Even so, buying things during this period is extremely frustrating when you constantly encounter network errors and you can't purchase anything because the cart keep prompting that it's empty. I think other than apologising and telling the rest of the reviewers that your team is working on it, Shopee better improve the user experience and or else be prepared to lose all your loyal customers to other platforms such as Lazada or Ezbuy.",0
872,Disappointed. My very 1st purchse ended with seller rejecting my request due to no stock. My 2nd purchase ended with long delivery time. I have waited 3 weeks and i have not recieve my items. No chance i will used this app again,0

917,"Update on 25052018: Hey shopee, you didn't help me back then, why now? 
Behind every one star review is a story. I use this app a lot and it 
usually does not give me much problems. But for one particular incident 
where I felt cheated, here's the story: Bought Hong Lian ghim kee's 5kg 
paddy king rice during time sale. Promo clearly shows that there will be 
free canola oil with every purchase of the rice. (Promo will only be worth 
it because of the foc oil.) During delivery, only 5kg rice came and the oil 
was never to be seen again. So with hope I opened the app hoping that I 
could solve the dispute. But to my horror, the picture showing the free 
gift has been removed in the listing and seller will not honour the free 
gift! Submitted claim and shoppee refuted my claim, saying that seller had 
delivered everything already. Unlike other apps which will solve such 
issues, shoppee does not. Please think twice before using this app.",0

this app because it doesnt let u get your refund when u didnt even freaking 
recieve your item like wth? So u all think that money is easy to earn until 
the point that u can anyhow release the payment to the seller when the 
seller never send us our item? So whats the point of having the refund 
button when shopee thinks that the seller is always right?? Plus this isnt 
the first time this thing happen the seller have already tried to scam me 
the second time and shopee is not even doing anything. Use this app at your 
own risk. EDIT : WHAT I OPT FOR IS STANDARD EXPRESS ( WHICH IS MORE 
EXPENSIVE AND ITS SUPPOSE TO BE GUARANTEED TO SEND IT TO MY DOORSTEP SO 
WHAT IS WITH THE FREAKING NOT LIABLE FOR LOST NORMAL MAIL THING WTH? U SURE 
WHAT I OPT FOR IS NORMAL MAILING? ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT EVEN EXPRESS

long, that makes them sometimes forget the unpaid deal, drag too long for

pretty vague for some products. The product uploaded keep being deleted for 
some weird and unclear reason.",0
937,"Shopee is totally not a safe platform for buyers to make their purchases as 
they do not provide any protection for the buyers when they do not receive 
their items, unlike Amazon/Ebay/AliExpress. The shopee admin/dispute 
resolution team is highly unprofessional and slow in resolving disputes. I 
waited close to a month and my item hasn't been delivered. Furthermore, the 
item was shipped from Singapore to a Singapore address. NO CARRIER in 
Singapore takes so long to deliver the items. Even items that I ordered 
from Ebay from US and from Aliexpress from China, only took 1.5 weeks and 2 
weeks respectively to arrive. Despite the seller having received close to 
170 negative reviews whereby other buyers complained about receiving the 
wrong items or not having received their items at all, no actions were 
taken against this seller and they were still allowed to sell their items 
on this platform. If such rogue behaviour of the seller were to be 
condoned, what confidence would buyers have in making purchases on this 
platform? All the emphasis on advertising on Buyer's protection and 
guarantee are just cheap talk as they aren't backed up by concrete actions. 
Buyers, PLEASE RECONSIDER before using this app for your purchases, if at 
all.",0

943,System is laggy. Payment process in system takes too long and frequency of failure is 9 out of 10. Ended up the stocks in flash deal are often out of stock after umpteen retries attempt for payment.  Delivery of stocks are often more than 3 weeks. A lot more longer than sellers from other platforms.,0
944,Many of the sellers in Shopee sucks. Make me wait for month / weeks then inform you no stock. Waste time. Won't be using this app anymore,0
945,"When I search for a product other products are appearing sometimes, how can I change it to peso sign to know how much it is in our country.",0
946,"I bought a printoss at Shopee. The seller takes more than a month to deliver the product. When I finally receive it, it's faulty. I used 3 film cartridges (worth $30) trying out the faulty printoss. I had to go all the way to bugis to return the product before I can receive my refund. I think shopee has very very poor buyer protection policy. I felt so cheated dealing with that seller and Shopee did not interfere or help in anyway. I do not recommend buying any high value product at Shopee. No good buyer protection policy. No PayPal. No good customer service. Worst experience .",0

They allow buyers to leave spiteful & negative feedbacks hence damaging seller's shop ratings without considering the possibility that the buyer herself could have damaged the item due to her own misuse & still wants a refund (buyer left 5 star ratings when she initially received the item & 1 week later changed her rating to 1 star). Sellers, beware!  《UPDATE》 Before Shopee starts giving me a template ""Cut & Paste"" reply by thanking me for bringing this to their attention and then asking me to email them, I HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT! And the reply from them is that they believe the buyer and NOT me, the seller. So according to them, there is NOTHING they can do to help me except to ask me to go ""beg"" the buyer to delete or change her rating. Some customer service I am getting here. Disappointing!",0

And now the seller wouldn't even reply to my messages and is not following up anymore! What protection is that for buyers?!",0
952,Cannot load the app. Hope shopee try protect sellers also. Sometime i am scared that buyers would not click order received even when i passed them the items.

They have also just banned my family member account just because we are buying voucher together due to daily limit of shoppee and does not allow any appeal. Such a shame.",0

They only say they investigate the matter but it is a complete waste of time because their explanations is so general that shows they did nothing, just pretend to be doing something by delaying the reply.

Service is poor and their there is little or no resolution for defective and faulty items. U have just 24 hours to make a complain regarding item. My 1st and only complaint within 24 hrs was ignored and payment released due to their oversight. Then promised a call back but none. After getting so many defective and counterfeit products, I feel lazada is the better platform at least u can feedback and a high chance of refund. This shopee platform is full of counterfeit sellers that sell fake OEM products and claim they are genuine. With Shopee u r screwed, u might as well ship the item directly from alibaba or taobao.",0

1006,"Extremely disappointing. Signed up on 3 May 2020. Welcome gift couldn't be redeemed, fine. However, voucher for my first purchase also couldn't be used so I sought help. Shopee Live chat said they would escalate the issue but didn't get back. On 6 May, i wrote in again. Only on 19 May night was someone assigned to help. After i replied with the voucher error message, they said i am permanently limited because of 'activities' and this ban non-appealable. I didn't even do anything. Amazing.",0
1007,"Shopee should make all sellers indicate the exact location of the shipment and not just ""overseas"". There are so many sellers with .sg names but items are shipped from China! This is so misleading and it's too late to cancel my order by the time I realised it.",0

1009,"I used to purchase items which gains my trust in buying, however products quality defects recently have a surge in rise. plus buying makes disappointment in what was advertise. moreover seller items are not very reliable when selling.

1020,Impossible to plant anything other than coins nowadays. Previously it was much more easier,0
1021,Worst call centre template customer service ever. Don't bother to solve issues and either ask us to contact the seller to troubleshoot or ask us to wait and see if the problem will resolve by itself.. what a joke.,0
1022,"Place another order on 17 May via bank transfer, 18 May received a SMS say that the payment not verified and order been cancelled.... Check the app, indicated the order is pending shipment.....

Seller said I am making false claim against him even with photo of the broken parts. That dumbo seller don't even know his product. Next I went to shopee to ask for a refund. After they asked for video proof and then with a long delay, finally they came back and asked me to return and produce the proof of return within 3 days during this CB period.",0
1027,"2nd review now after 1st mysteriously disappeared. My feedback remains the same, this is a joke of a shopping platform where you can't redeem the gift for new user due to ""network error"" but no such issue with buying other items. Coupons for new user ends up in the invalid section on the same day when you sign up. Seriously if you can't afford the marketing budget to attract new user that's fine. Just don't over promise and under deliver... and stop deleting negative feedback.",0
1028,t&c are so grey,0
1029,"Full of fake vendors (purchase a product and suddenly it is out of stock, and they try to replace with a lower quality product, at same price of course). Also, Shopee cheats you with the deposit that cannot be refunded. When checking with the support team they told me that I just need to close my account and I'll get an email to get my deposit back. It's been 2 weeks I closed and no email. Shoppe simply robbed me 150$. Don't waste time with it, competitors are more serious and honest",0

1035,Useless app and CS doesn't help,0
1036,"Sucks la the app, the UI seriously damn dumb, what for have payment page when people not going to pay at 7-11 or cheers, the stupid payment page is just a scam so less people can use vouchers and coupon codes cos once you're in it, going back means your vouchers and coupon codes applied are gone already. Raise query, say will get back within 1 day but after 1 week already still no word from Shopee. Worse service ever. I deleted the app and once I receive all my items, I'm deleting my account.",0
1037,"Beware its littered with fakes/false advertising And return policies are very dubious I wish you the best of luck when dealing with returns The items advertised may not be same as what your receive and that's with confirmation from seller Eg EDP on ad, received EDT Stick to lazada app Being sorry isn't good enough when it comes to money, have better protection for your customers, consistent policies.",0

When i chat with Live Agent, instead of checking 1st, they suggest i click refund. But i want the items! Said they will check, but no update few days later.

1053,Bad!! They removed my previous review!! Horrible!,0
1054,"Disappointed over and over again. I have been chasing their customer service to help me add my phone number and address to my account.

Its not my bank problem definitely i already checked....pls fix this asap,0
1064,Error on credit card payment. Rectify please.,0
1065,"Terrible. The app is glitchy as hell. Caused a ruckus and made me look like an idiot for the mistake that their app made. Instead of assisting me, I had to fix the issue myself. And even so I cant do nothing about my parcel. Filed for dispute and Shopee refuses to refund me. Really, I was gonna get lots stuffs from your platform but looking at how the issue was handled, I would rather shop elsewhere. It isn't about the amount, it's the service provided.",0

1071,Really troublesome platform!! Not user friendly at all!!,0
1072,Merchant can choose to back off the deal (including flash deals) anytime they wish to just by telling u some crappy excuses. Not that trustworthy app afterall. CSO can't give u an answer but to tell u to cancel and get your refund.,0
1073,"Shopee Dispute agent is not so responsive. They don't value buyer feedback and in fact, they do not chat with us more in details to find out of our problems. Hence I feel the dispute service is not so effective if the seller is using fake description and playing with words. In the end buyer gotta accept the facts.",0
1074,"After update the screen resolution (page too big for mobile viewing) having issue when click into shopee, will be kicked out from app and need to re-launch app again. Also shopee customer support response is slow and sometime no response. Shopee Farm harvested item order was cancelled without refund or replacement.",0
1075,Terrible. App became really slow after being updated. Many times it got stalled when i clicked it and suddenly the screen turned into an all white blank page. Really disappointed.,0
1076,No paylah or paynow functions. Still using very ancient way of making bank transfer and verifying via screenshot which takes 3 days to process on shopee end. Concern about security.,0

Service centre is not helpful in retrieving my codes and just tell me account suspension is final. Very disappointed because i have been using shopee for so many years and this is how they treat their long term customer just because of some unusual activity their system detected and they do not even explain what is unusual.",0
1086,Please google (shopee seller scam before you decide to use this app) Be sure when you receive your item please don't confirm receive until you check. Onces press receive means no refund becuz payment will go to the seller. No matter what shopee will not protect you as you agree as received. 1. App problem 2. Customer service suck the q keep you waiting not like aliexpress 3. Even if Seller send damage goods to you they cant do anything for your refund.,0
1087,I think it's horrible to force the customer to download the app just to check on their orders - why can't i do so via the online site instead.,0

Even after several updates, the issue is still present",0
1099,Why do you make it soooooo difficult to choose between credit cards to pay or delete? And whats with the app not working unless we update proactively? Ie theres no notification msg to update leaving me with wasted time wondering why stuff doesnt work. Fire your UI team. They are incompetent. What a crappy user experience.,0

If you guys shoppe HQ updated your apps to a better version please do not let us having all these problems where we cant order things in shope.. We pay for our mobile data,0
1109,"Sorry to do this, but I have to say it's a bit weird for me that seller has 7 days to prepare for sending out goods:( I understand maybe they have to get the items ready, but the better way is to have good by hand and can send out goods ASAP right after the payment is confirmed! And I realized that I couldn't even reach online seller (first time user) and the service bot just really disappointed human beings! 3 days should be maximum for goods ready, otherwise don't put the goods on website.",0
1110,Deleting account is so troublesome!!!!!!,0
1111,After updated I am unable to view my previous purchase..and also unable to make payment for my order,0
1112,Shopee is such a cheat. I received a wrong order and reported it. I never received the refund and kept on chasing the sender.,0
1113,The system sucks. They should take a page out of Amazon where they only deduct payment after item is shipped. This gives the buyer time to reconsider and cancel his order. Sadly they will hold your $ and the seller might take 4 weeks just to ship your item and your $ is stucked. Would never buy anything using Shopee anymore. ADDITIONAL NOTE: Shopee requires you to handle your own returns. Unlike Lazada which provides returning services. Another good reason not to use this app :),0
1114,Horrible app with horrible customer service. Did not honour their own promotions and kept blaming the customer and the bank,0
1115,".I want to highlight to all about Shopee and the Seller(guyshero.sg)On 5/4/20 my order was placed and on 15/4/20 J&T Express sms me that my parcel was out for delivery but till now it was not delivered.e I considered the parcel is lost and I requested for cancellation as it would not take that long in Singapore ,almost 16 days.So during this period, I had follow up with Shopee's staff Hakim,Nur Natashah & Zikril and J&T Express and they still want me to wait further.Must be fair to me.Frustrated",0

1117,"I wouldn't use this app again, at least for a long time until they catch up on both the technological and human performances. The pages load extremely slowly or cannot load, they don't integrate with foreign credit cards, and there are errors everywhere ( from shipping options to stock availability). The welcome gift disappeared after they collected my credentials and they still expect me to rate it! Furthermore, they really should train their sellers to be more friendly.",0
1118,SCAM Shopee MY apps- I couldn't view items purchased after making payment in My Purchases folder and was prompted to download Shopee client to view the folder. Shopee client download was not successful either. My user account disappeared after 2 days. Closed and re-opened the apps and Shopee MY apps is missing from my hp. Terrible apps! RM120++ is not big deal either but it is really annoying to be cheated by an apps advertised on TV for Hari Raya.,0
1119,The platform may be good but the vendors are irresponsible. They do not update that there will be delay or something in regards to the item ordered. Some vendors don't even response quickly.,0
1120,When I use referral code it says invalid even if it a valid code and i am new user. Pls fix this,0

1127,"All Shopee knows how to do is pay lip service and say sorry to the buyers and continue to let the seller's scam people on its platform. If u shop here, you're on your own. It's not worth buying any big ticket items off them. Avoid this app at all costs",0

Local seller same day handover the item to (home delivery company) but I know don't why the delivery company keep more then 5 days in they store.If improved i will 5 star.,0
1132,Poor customer service by shopee. Any disputes will be settled with shopee siding with the merchants,0
1133,"Shopee is a biased platform whom sides sellers more than buyers. These words came from Shopee CSR themselves that Sellers are able to delete ratings from buyers without consent from buyers. Hence, it is impossible to know if sellers on the platform are reputable or not even based on the ratings as dishonest sellers are able to remove the 'bad' ratings from buyers, to 'look good'. Not recommending this unfair platform to any others!",0

1136,freeze & freeze & freeze,0
1137,NOT RECOMMEND! Bad experience with Dispute Resolution... does not help customer with disputes. I made a mistake to think that 'Buy 2 items for $25' to mean get 2 pieces at the price of $25. The item retails for $16; way over priced if only 1 piece at $25.99. Shopee condones sellers' over pricing and profiteering. How to trust such a platform with unscrupulous sellers. Shopee deleted my 1 star rating given to the seller!!!!! Will certainly be deleting Shopee!!!!!,0
1138,"Terrible service they give. I order 5 item, end up my parcel came incomplete. Open a dispute chat. Stated my intention is for the seller to send the remaining item asap. Or full refund me and send their courier to collect the item from me. Yet they only listen to the seller and not the buyer. The dispute team close my dispute chat and accept the partial refund from the seller which is what i doesnt want. They help dishonest seller like sunflowerbaby.sg",0

1143,Avoid buying things from shopee. I have already reported the app to google for being a fraud. Items bought were never shipped by the sellers and shopee is not doing anything to stop these scammers. Lets report the app to get it removed from the playstore.

Ask the seller only use the generate message to responce on it also don't even reply what you ask.,0
1195,Failure to control the prices and allowing the retailers to inflate their prices during this COVID-19 situation shows a lack of ethics on both the retailers' and Shopee's end (also a lack of crisis management and proper planning).

1412,I have encountered several dubious shady sellers since I started on Shopee about 1+ months ago. These sellers give Shopee a bad name. 1st seller sent me a message claiming the item is out of stock but I noticed it is still available but at a higher price! 2nd seller also claim another product is out of stock but the item continues to be put up for sale on Shopee. Also 'big thick bath towel' turned out to be only a small thin face towel. Many of Shopee's sellers are unreliable.,0

1870,"Dear fellow Singaporeans, make sure whatever you shop, be extra more careful. Although products are cheap, quality sometimes very 👎👎 And when you ask for a refund, the seller will say , you are not reasonable ,and when you want to cancelled the order, they will try to find ways , and the order will still be on its way to you, although u already cancelled it n demand refund. And Shopee does not help much. They will asked you to email/call/ explain/ sent photos to Shopee , investigate further n etc. which frankly speaking, it does not help. You ll be at the losing end, wasting time and don't get back your refund. Just be careful , when you buy online products.",0

This application management attitude is poor. Better buy at Taobao ori apps, more quality assurance and refund.",0
1876,The user interface of this application is very messy. The refund resolution by shopee is very tedious. And they are very careless.

Too much managing restrictoins in sellers as compared to other selling platform",0

Was extremely disappointed when I have missed a couple of flash deals because of the network issues. Even so, buying things during this period is extremely frustrating when you constantly encounter network errors and you can't purchase anything because the cart keep prompting that it's empty. I think other than apologising and telling the rest of the reviewers that your team is working on it, Shopee better improve the user experience and or else be prepared to lose all your loyal customers to other platforms such as Lazada or Ezbuy.",0

1936,"Shopee is totally not a safe platform for buyers to make their purchases as 
they do not provide any protection for the buyers when they do not receive 
their items, unlike Amazon/Ebay/AliExpress. The shopee admin/dispute 
resolution team is highly unprofessional and slow in resolving disputes. I 
waited close to a month and my item hasn't been delivered. Furthermore, the 
item was shipped from Singapore to a Singapore address. NO CARRIER in 
Singapore takes so long to deliver the items. Even items that I ordered 
from Ebay from US and from Aliexpress from China, only took 1.5 weeks and 2 
weeks respectively to arrive. Despite the seller having received close to 
170 negative reviews whereby other buyers complained about receiving the 
wrong items or not having received their items at all, no actions were 
taken against this seller and they were still allowed to sell their items 
on this platform. If such rogue behaviour of the seller were to be 
condoned, what confidence would buyers have in making purchases on this 
platform? All the emphasis on advertising on Buyer's protection and 
guarantee are just cheap talk as they aren't backed up by concrete actions.

where I felt cheated, here's the story: Bought Hong Lian ghim kee's 5kg 
paddy king rice during time sale. Promo clearly shows that there will be 
free canola oil with every purchase of the rice. (Promo will only be worth 
it because of the foc oil.) During delivery, only 5kg rice came and the oil 
was never to be seen again. So with hope I opened the app hoping that I 
could solve the dispute. But to my horror, the picture showing the free 
gift has been removed in the listing and seller will not honour the free 
gift! Submitted claim and shoppee refuted my claim, saying that seller had 
delivered everything already. Unlike other apps which will solve such 
issues, shoppee does not. Please think twice before using this app.",0

2009,"I have always love shoppee... Recently, for a week, I realised that whenever I pressed the cart, I was not directed to my cart. Instead the app got hung. I have to uninstall and install back. Then I will be able to go to my cart. But only once. Once I get out of the cart, I can't go back. I have to again uninstall and install. This has caused such a hassle. I hope something can be done.",0
2010,"Shopee used to be one of the better online purchasing platforms. But recently they lowered the value of their vouchers from 20% to 15%. Probably to cover the cost of hiring Christiano Ronaldo. Edit: Reduced one more star as they've made it more difficult to get coins. Daily check-in coins reduced, shopee throw coins fully redeemed, limit to max 50 coins earned per purchase. Now they have their ""million dollar discount"" promo but it's just to make users unable to use their coins exchanged voucher",0

2015,The push notification could not be turned off properly even I updated the software 3 times over the last 2 weeks. Very annoying notification due to this bug. Attached the screen shot for your references which clearly shown that all possible notification have been turn off in the Shopee feedback form.,0
2016,Shopee was one of my favourite app for shopping online. Its service was very good. As I always get my items on time. And if its delay I would still be able to speak to the customer. But recently shopee as been a disappointment to me. I would have to wait ages for my item and after that they will recommend me to ask for refund. Still glad they could refund me back.,0
2017,Too many notifications. Very annoying. Just refuses to let you delete account and details even though the sales transaction was completed. Would never use again.,0
2018,For god sake yr welcome gift T&C isnt stated clearly. I ordered a item so I can get the free welcome gift without feeling bad. After that try selecting a free gift and keep getting a error.

2045,"It used to be good. I didn't have any problems ordering or buying stuffs but recently, the platform sucks. The platform won't allow me or the seller to cancel the order and the auto cancellation system kept dragging the cancellation date. I did ask the customer service personnels to help but all they could suggest is to ask me 'to wait till the auto cancellation occur'. I will uninstall this app once I received my refunds. EDIT 1: I did sent 3 feedbacks and the replies are all the same; asking me to wait till the auto cancellation date occurs. so please don't ask me to send anymore feedbacks unless you can really do something about it . EDIT 2 : Finally the transaction has been cancelled after sending 3 emails to ask for a solution. If i didn't brought this issue here, i doubt anything will be done other than asking me to wait.

So much money spent on marketing but the platform is such a mess.",0
2075,- Bank transfer day is short. - Transfer on that day of purchase but just overlook snapshot receipt on that day and transaction cancel the next day. - Shopee can't anyhow cancel transaction without inform and more worst can't retrieved back. - Email took so long to reply. - Call helpline yet no help given only reply we can't do anything. -Seller took long to reply or even no reply.,0
2076,Server errors are frequent. Sellers are either not responsive or take a long time to reply. Customer service is disappointing. Why not just using chatbot if the customer service is there to give standard replies. The prices of most products are competitive than many other e-commerce platforms and that is the only reason I still keep the app.,0
2077,"Terrible payment. For a long time I have been using credit/debit payment without any glitch. Today, I kept being denied of my payment. Error message: Oops payment failed.

2082,"edit: my issues was resolved, however the app design is still quite bad. opening a new in-app browser for every link i press makes it annoying when i have multiple layers of it opened. consider changing it to use the existing in-app browser if one is already open.",0

2101,I think it's a very cheap tactic to only allow me to customize email setting using the app. I only installed the app to cancel all email notifications from Shopee. Why isn't there an option to do that on the website itself?,0

Case: bought item that does not work from foreign seller. Engage seller: no response for several days  When a response came no solution was offered. Engage shopee support: replied but asked to wait for 3 days. Waited for weeks and no response from shopee Tried to contact shopee again non responsive.   Buy shopee products from foreign seller at your own risk. You will have no support from shopee or the seller thereafter.   Wanted to give a 3 star but nope. Since foreign seller are a big part of shopee they dont deserve the extra star!  Disappointed,0

Soon? ??,0

2362,All the items which I've liked DID NOT show up on My Likes and its very tedious to trace them again because I literally searched for hours and there's quite a number of them. The app wasn't so buggy back then but what happened lol,0
2363,Been always good but I can't suddenly view my cart. Tried chatting with help centre yet no solution.,0
2364,"Past 1 week I cannot add to cart and cannot reach my cart to check out too. I had spoke to someone in shopee. Not sure what updates you had made to cause this. I had uninstalled multiple times. Since my phone is brand new, I even factory reset my phone. Nothing works.",0
2365,Allows seller to sell products that does not tally with the information and no punishment to such seller. Disappointing in their customer service and investigation team for not doing and let such seller continue to sell their products. Shopee please protect the buyer from such sellers.,0
2366,"I have always love shoppee... Recently, for a week, I realised that whenever I pressed the cart, I was not directed to my cart. Instead the app got hung. I have to uninstall and install back. Then I will be able to go to my cart. But only once. Once I get out of the cart, I can't go back. I have to again uninstall and install. This has caused such a hassle. I hope something can be done.",0
2367,Shopee now so slow keeps lagging.. how many times i uninstall and install again but still same issue so hard to check out..and i guess they should haved estimated time for delivery because parcel always missed when delivered.,0

2374,"Shopee used to be one of the better online purchasing platforms. But recently they lowered the value of their vouchers from 20% to 15%. Probably to cover the cost of hiring Christiano Ronaldo. Edit: Reduced one more star as they've made it more difficult to get coins. Daily check-in coins reduced, shopee throw coins fully redeemed, limit to max 50 coins earned per purchase. Now they have their ""million dollar discount"" promo but it's just to make users unable to use their coins exchanged voucher",0

2378,Shopee was one of my favourite app for shopping online. Its service was very good. As I always get my items on time. And if its delay I would still be able to speak to the customer. But recently shopee as been a disappointment to me. I would have to wait ages for my item and after that they will recommend me to ask for refund. Still glad they could refund me back.,0

2381,"Terribly inflexible customer service. I was in a hurry and accidentally exchanged my shopee coins for a $5 shopee mall voucher instead of the $5 beauty voucher that I wanted. Both cost the same amount of coins to exchange for. Approached the live chat agent on the SAME DAY to ask for a cancellation of the $5 shopee mall voucher exchange and was flatly denied. For a transaction that was made less than half a day ago, they couldn't make a simple exception to enhance a longterm customer experience.",0

2387,"It used to be good. I didn't have any problems ordering or buying stuffs but recently, the platform sucks. The platform won't allow me or the seller to cancel the order and the auto cancellation system kept dragging the cancellation date. I did ask the customer service personnels to help but all they could suggest is to ask me 'to wait till the auto cancellation occur'. I will uninstall this app once I received my refunds. EDIT 1: I did sent 3 feedbacks and the replies are all the same; asking me to wait till the auto cancellation date occurs. so please don't ask me to send anymore feedbacks unless you can really do something about it . EDIT 2 : Finally the transaction has been cancelled after sending 3 emails to ask for a solution. If i didn't brought this issue here, i doubt anything will be done other than asking me to wait. I have yet to receive any emails or messages stating whether i will be receiving any refunds.",0

But due to CNY.. xiaomi did not mail out my order.. and Shopee system auto cancelled my order.. now i have to wait for xiaomi to respones.",0
2397,At first was fantastic but now you asked for different thing shopee will corner you to other things. Furthermore some of the sellers are not serious about selling and not sincere. Nowadays getting similar with geeks,0
2398,"I ordered 10 parcels and the sellers cancelled 3 of them. I never experienced anything like that when online shopping. However, it's happened because shopee let unauthorized seller work in their flatform. Never buy again.",0

2529,"I need to add shipping address, but i tried via app, web browser, PC...none works. Even tried amending and deleting the default address but nothing seems to work too. There doesn't seem to be an in-app option to to report bugs. Pls rectify. Thanks.",0
2530,I hate it that you used the F*** up service of Ninja Van. the app experienced should be already perfect but instead ... everytime that Co. would give stress and bad experienced to us buyer ... they never lived up on the agreed time .. they waste mine and other peoples time with there way of handling your deliveries.,0

2538,Bought several items using shopee. Dealing with local seller have been excellent however foreign sellers are as untrustworthy as shopee support.  Case: bought item that does not work from foreign seller. Engage seller: no response for several days  When a response came no solution was offered. Engage shopee support: replied but asked to wait for 3 days. Waited for weeks and no response from shopee Tried to contact shopee again non responsive.   Buy shopee products from foreign seller at your own risk. You will have no support from shopee or the seller thereafter.   Wanted to give a 3 star but nope. Since foreign seller are a big part of shopee they dont deserve the extra star!  Disappointed,0

2588,..way of transfer via ibanking. Must upload screenshot for what?! Then u ask to put my username as initial but it was stated wayat the bottom. I didnt know and put my real name. Annoying AF!!!,0

2590,unfair dispute resolution,0
2591,"Although tools for selling are advanced, however it can't really generate sales. But you can Really get   good deals often from coupon codes.",0
2592,Everything is long winded. Feedback take 3 days. Shopee take more days to get back to u to confirm ur purchase. Better direct wif seller,0
2593,"Today shopee is very laggy, and everytime I tried to open an item, no pics no price nothing is loaded!",0
2594,"Please improve the scrolling and page loading speed. It is especially slow and 'stucks' when scrolling the listing, as compared to ""C"".         Will give 4 stars instead if this is fixed.",0

2597,Using filter and after viewing item the page refresh and goes back to top of page. Damn irritating to rescroll all the way down to where I last viewed. It was so bad that I gave up finding and buying from here.,0
2598,"Takes too long to transfer payment to sellers. ""3 to 5 working days"" is a gross understatement. Smart notifications are actually pretty dumb as you can't opt out of ads without sacrificing the proper alerts.",0
2599,I received a discount code today and it said that i can get a $10 discount with minimum purchase of $20. At the checkout area it said that the discount code is invalid,0

2603,"I have problems getting the verification code. Keep saying network error. Then when i reinstall, i cant even log into my acc anymore. Pls kindly fix this. Thanks",0
2604,To be honest first imp of shopee is a replica of carousell . Initially I thought it was good because it can prevent scams from seller. But shopee is taking way too long to transfer the Amt to me when the deal was completed for quite sometime. Hence evn with this added feature I disliked it. I hope the time to transfer completed deals can be improved p.s I still haven got my money when the deal was completed a week before and they actually prompt tt they are transferring soon? 1 week alr? Soon? ??,0
2605,"Like Trezo photo upload option is limited. Carousell has a wider range of options and allows photo upload from dropbox, which makes it a much better and convenient app for sellers.",0
2606,I see what  good in sell than buy here on mobile:),0

2615,Why does nothing ever load. Sometimes the app works fine but somedays blank page appear everywhere and nothing appears when I search. Please fix your app or unstable server.,0
2616,"After my last feedback, Shopee responded fast and I did see improvements in the cashback portion. For online chat agents, it will be great if they are more well equipped with basic platform knowledge to reply customers.",0
2617,"Different ways to add vouchers. Confusing. Almost missed out the voucher thinking it doesn't work, lucky the seller helped me troubleshoot.",0
2618,"Always facing issue that the page doesn't load in flash deal after select a few tab, no matter from timing or category.",0

2622,"After update, I cannot share items via WhatsApp, I press share, press whatsapp button and no response. This problem happens to my other phone and tablet. The daily $1 deals have another problem. When I click view winner, pages load promptly but after a few second it dissappear. Lastly in my cart, when I try to delete my items in cart it does not response. All these happens in my other phone and tablets. Bugs can be reproduce easily.",0
2623,I much prefer the older version when my feed wasn't cluttered with posts from people i don't follow. It makes it hard to see updates from the shops i actually followed. I'm not interested in seeing those irrelevant posts. Please bring back the older version. Edit: don't understand why the daily log in for coins decreased so much.,0
2624,Need to fix the issue of to long lagging and at times it hangs frequently.,0
2625,"Quite buggy these few days, not sure if it because of the new shoppe games they came out with. But the overall experience was better last time, now it keep resizing when I open. Sometimes its perfect, sometimes it way too zoomed in and I'll have to restart the app",0
2626,Able to find products and relate well with platform. Thank you.,0
2627,"I will like this app better if I can use up to 6k shopee coin to offset 30% of the purchase. Reason being that the all day vouchers is set at 10% to the cap of $20. Meaning it encourages user to spent $200 to hit the cap. And the use of shopee coin is set at 30% to a cap of $10 or 1k shoppee coins. That is how i come up to 6k shopee coin as 30% of $200 is $60 or 6k shopee coins. In my opinion, it is more reward to shop at shopee if purchase is upto $30.",0
2628,"The apps keep hanging everytime i scroll to flash deal. Halfway scroll surely hang. Got to close the app and start scrolling again. This has been happening for a week. I tot it was my network. But nope, its this app development is lagging. Pls look into it.",0

2644,So far so good. But Shopee keep sending unnecessary notifications or advertisements.,0
2645,"Experience is smooth , just that shoppee say will pay $5 discount for me but never",0

2664,The shipping n delivery info always not up to date. It can stop there for long time without updating.,0
2665,Getting a refund is a hassle.,0
2666,"Shopee has one of the worst customer service I've seen. Troubleshooting to them just prompts them to say ""have you cleared cache?"" when the mistake is obviously them and they don't try to fix it the 1st time round. Happened twice.",0
2667,Overall ok but services can be improved. Should allow hassle-free return of items. And request for order cancellation should not be subject to approval of seller. How can sellers reject the request when the items are not shipped yet?? And I'm not happy that reimbursement of postage is capped at max SGD10 only.,0
2668,Easy shopping!!!! Nice experience.,0
2669,Good app. Bought 2 items so far.,0
2670,Good access platform to shop,0
2671,Items are not receiving exactly what we order. often our order is missing and the status shows delivered. Had a worst experience twice.,0
2672,"Apps is OK, the only problem is that it like to refresh to the start when I am just scrolling through the product listing.",0

2678,Need bug fix. Unable to make purchase with notice saying seller is on vacation. Yet i could make the same transaction on web platform. Edit: Thanks Shopee for the reply. I tried the customer service form. Not able to submit at all. No matter which method used.,0
2679,Shipping status need more timely update,0
2680,Basically when you see the items in shopee seems cheaper and mostly free shipping! The tricky part is it comes with condition you have to wait for a month to receive the items that's not efficiency. Especially some shops did not state from which country or when is the date we can receive before we buy the item is just shipping date! These have to be improved to be more competitive against other online shopping.,0
2681,"Very easy to use, tracking is accurate. So far happy with the purchases, speed of delivery.",0
2682,"App used to be mostly stable when using in the past. Recently app has been glitching so much, makes using the app quite unpleasant. Hope developers can work on improving the stability of the UI.",0
2683,The app can be quite laggy. The iPad version sometimes need to force close. It would be better if the website version allow customers to view their favourite products.,0

2688,Sometimes it lagged during flash sale caused me to missed on the deal. Please fix it. Thank you!,0

2706,Most of the items are from China. Local seller are quite reliable.,0
2707,"App getting slower , products getting more expensive",0
2708,There are some errant sellers on the platform and Shopee support is failing to address some of these issues. 99 cents flash sale where seller wants to be advertised but fail to deliver goods at that price and cancels my order. This app is overtaking Lazada and Qoo10. #1 choice for my online shopping.,0
2709,Good so far til today. My shopping cart is unable to be opened.,0
2710,average due to no tracking id,0
2711,"Don't select all the cart items automatically, let us select ourselves",0
2712,"The app crashes on me most of the time, especially when it comes checking out my cart but it's okay. One thing I didn't like is that they categoried plus size clothing into its own category but I find most of the items I used to find normally are not there, which makes me have to go through more searching and keywords and filters",0
2713,"Honestly , i love using shopee. But it has errors when i try to pay ! Server error. And once my order got cancelled for no reason at all. Even tho i had already paid for the items. I dont know how to solved this.",0
2714,"Feeling quite negative recently as orders had been delayed and met unresponsive sellers as well. Despite extending gurantee, no response from sellers. Worst is, cancellation will be subjected to seller's agreement which I find it very unfair. Shipment delayed, seller always been indicated on vacation. Having 3 shipments delayed and felt so helpless.",0
2715,"I purchased a vinyl sticker for my car. It was delivered to me with a missing character. The seller insisted that i was trying to scam him. Brought it up to shopee and i was told to wait a few days before an agent will get back to me. At the same time the seller throwed shade, saying that i have no culture as a singaporean. A few days later a Shopee agent came back to me asking if i would accept a partial refund. WHY WOULD I ACCEPT A PARTIAL REFUND? Why would i use a damaged vinyl on my car?",0
2716,Items limited hope that can join venture with Lazada as well.,0
2717,"Hais.. Pls fix the cart... Every time i go to the cart, 20 items are automatically selected for me... Which is a hassle to untick everything. Wasnt like this before",0

2724,Application is good bit I don't like the shopee agreement and policy. When I want to return the product shoppe is giving credit only to the seller and they are not considering the customer request. I hate this. So for the costly product I prefer other online portal.,0
2725,"Hi developer, I really love shop on your site both on shopee SG and MY.

2726,"I was initially happy with Shopee but lately i've been getting wrong orders sent to me. Wrong size, wrong type, etc. Out of 10 orders, i can expect 3 to go wrong. As a loyal customer who uses no other shopping app, is this fair to me? To be fair, Shopee would usually grant my request for a refund but all this shouldn't be happening in the first place anyway. It's really a waste of my time and does spoil my mood as i would actually look forward for my items to arrive.",0
2727,1. it has become laggy. 2. they should screen their sellers to protect buyers. Some buyers are real scammers. 3. this app is still more user friendly than q10 and ezbuy 4. should give better vouchers q10 has better vouchers. 5. the coins are very little compared to q10. 6. some times it is difficult to find a product as they do not have picture recognition 7. the pricing of goods from the same sellers on q10 are more expensive in shopee 8. flash sale needs improvement,0
2728,Good app with reasonable price,0
2729,3.75 stars.Safe shopping but can't find any Chinese herbs to shop. Hope there will be Chinese herbs to buy.,0
2730,"single item limit max shopee coin use is $10 is ok, but hope the shopee coin limit can increase more than $10 when more items are purchase, cause if not when have alot things I want to buy everyday only can buy 1 and wait for the next day than can buy the second item, 10 items I must spent 10 days to buy them all, thank u.",0

2740,Still need some improvement for loading pages. But wonderful deals to buy at certain hours of the day.,0
2741,Please implement a delete/edit option at the Recently Viewed list for easier organisation and better shopping experience. It would also be good if we can combine the usage of seller/shop voucher together with cart voucher.,0

2801,Beware of scammers using this app (and others) as a mean to scam you by asking for your OTP numbers and taking away your hard earn money. so far Shopee have no way yet to counter this and stop or hold a transaction when requested even after a police report being made.

2806,Not easy to contact Shoppee when there is delivery issue. I don't seems to be able to find a contact number to speak to customer service unlike the other online shops.,0

There's no option to choose the type of mailing you want either. Honestly i'd rather waste $2.24 for registered mail than give shopee and the seller money for something that i'll never get. It's a bad experience on my part. I just wish that Shopee would refund what the seller refuses to. Probably wouldn't shop here again.",0

3076,"Quite buggy these few days, not sure if it because of the new shoppe games they came out with. But the overall experience was better last time, now it keep resizing when I open. Sometimes its perfect, sometimes it way too zoomed in and I'll have to restart the app",0

3102,Good shopping shop 😁,0
3103,"I will like this app better if I can use up to 6k shopee coin to offset 30% of the purchase. Reason being that the all day vouchers is set at 10% to the cap of $20. Meaning it encourages user to spent $200 to hit the cap. And the use of shopee coin is set at 30% to a cap of $10 or 1k shoppee coins. That is how i come up to 6k shopee coin as 30% of $200 is $60 or 6k shopee coins. In my opinion, it is more reward to shop at shopee if purchase is upto $30.",0
3104,Used to love it. But it keeps hanging at a certain page. Previously it was the game page now its my shopping cart. Is there a bug or something???,0

Lastly in my cart, when I try to delete my items in cart it does not response. All these happens in my other phone and tablets. Bugs can be reproduce easily.",0
3108,"Too much clutter in the interface, shopping experience could and should be much more streamlined",0
3109,Many service oriented companies slackened over time due to one of many reasons: providing less value to consumers,0
3110,Overall ok but services can be improved. Should allow hassle-free return of items. And request for order cancellation should not be subject to approval of seller. How can sellers reject the request when the items are not shipped yet?? And I'm not happy that reimbursement of postage is capped at max SGD10 only.,0
3111,Nce,0
3112,Would be better if Shoppee offers Paypal paymet like Qoo10.sg for buyer protection,0
3113,"I was initially happy with Shopee but lately i've been getting wrong orders sent to me. Wrong size, wrong type, etc. Out of 10 orders, i can expect 3 to go wrong. As a loyal customer who uses no other shopping app, is this fair to me? To be fair, Shopee would usually grant my request for a refund but all this shouldn't be happening in the first place anyway. It's really a waste of my time and does spoil my mood as i would actually look forward for my items to arrive.",0
3114,unable to fully load Flash Sales. Will be better if can change username or select anonymous when reviewing. Have recieved some sellers requested me to give 5 stars review when I only gave 3 stars and below with exchange of partial refunds or future discount.,0

3157,Happy using it,0
3158,Beware of scammers using this app (and others) as a mean to scam you by asking for your OTP numbers and taking away your hard earn money. so far Shopee have no way yet to counter this and stop or hold a transaction when requested even after a police report being made.

3181,Basically when you see the items in shopee seems cheaper and mostly free shipping! The tricky part is it comes with condition you have to wait for a month to receive the items that's not efficiency. Especially some shops did not state from which country or when is the date we can receive before we buy the item is just shipping date! These have to be improved to be more competitive against other online shopping.,0

There's no option to choose the type of mailing you want either. Honestly i'd rather waste $2.24 for registered mail than give shopee and the seller money for something that i'll never get. It's a bad experience on my part. I just wish that Shopee would refund what the seller refuses to. Probably wouldn't shop here again.",0
3190,"Many products to buy & can compare price to different seller too , 品质不是很好！but most from china & sometime can""t tell or track untill you receive.

Verification SMS are often not sent to me, login to the seller web portal is a chore as I don't know my password (registered through FB). Can't use chat function on desktop though ad blocking is disabled. Keeps redirecting me home page or a blank page.   The good thing is it's escrow services which I have yet to use.",0

3377,"1. Please lock screen for typing of product description. Not able to see the text being keyed can be frustrating. 2. Payment to sellers can be expedited. While we make the effort to provide a good customer experience, we hope to be paid promptly too. Perhaps add c.o.d as another option. 3. For edit of photos, eg.

3386,"Still a lot can be improved... Interface is great but theres a clutter to it... Like the concept where you can see shipments... Overall better than Carousell but Carousell interface is a bit more fluid and simple whereas Shopee is a bit more detailed and filled with more features...

3397,"I would say this app have potential to compete with Carousell. However, this app needs to stay away for being too similar to Carousell. To put it bluntly, the whole UI is a complete ripoff - from homepage to listing etc. The only difference is the orange theme and other unique feature like money guarantee. Please do a UI redesign.",0
3398,Quite good and its ok,0

3403,Very easy to shop,0
3404,"Great shopping app, items are good and they have a nice insurance in the form of their Shopee Guarantee which ensures you receive your product and in good condition otherwise you can request a refund/return. However, one slight problem with the app is that you have to edit your photos first before you can upload them to your reviews/ratings, which is a bit of a hassle, only ""solution"" is to use in the in app camera feature.",1
3405,"You have great sellers, and you have great exposure so there's more choices for consumers, but you need to work on developing the app further, the app experience is still quite buggy, loading from page to page usually crash the app, otherwise I would gladly give a 5 star rating, but you are new, so work on it yeah, I use shopee all the time so I'm rooting for ya!",1
3406,"Very good app, bought many things with it. Prices are usually cheaper than Lazada and many shops offer free shipping or coupons to offset shipping fee. App also offers free coins when u give rating/review or other tasks for price deduction during check out. Edit: Shopee coupon lasts only 1 week and some electrical products are much more expensive than official brand's website. Google major brands before making any purchase.",1
3407,"Great app, but can be addictive though. Its a whole new world here, n you need to spend time sussing out the best deals. App actually helps u to save some moolah, if u have the time to play the games, plan the purchases according to the vouchers collected. One star short of full marks is the app lags a lot! Ive a samsung S20+, and the shopee app feels like a 70year old granny. Not good if u want to compete with the likes of Taobao, Lazada etc",1
3408,"Good app with good deals, from fashion to gadgets to supermart, with every types of items to be found in range locally and overseas. Quite a wide variety of choices at reasonable pricings. It's a good and reliable app. Just that some items may take longer than the stipulated time to arrive due to overseas shipping.",1
3409,"Good app with good deals. Only downside is there may be sellers who don't understand English, making communication with them extremely difficult. I got around the problem by communicating in Chinese. Good that the app supports Chinese text. Also, many of my items are actually shipped from China. It's like paying less for something not needed in a hurry. Good deals with local stocks are definitely a plus, like my recent purchase of pet product.",1
3410,Frequently the layout will be very zoomed in that it shows only 1 quarter of the page. Not sure why it happens. Have to close the app a few times before it goes back to normal. Lots of shopping vouchers now for shopee coins. Would be nice to have more actual cash off vouchers than for coins.,1
3411,"Great user interface design and easy navigation. The in built games are interesting and fun too! Two downside I have had is sellers PM to say item is out of stock but yet item is still out in the listing. Also the other being, if the overseas tracking can allow users to open up the actual web link of the service because there may be times where the tracking services be delayed due to some circumstances in which it is not stated in the app.",1
3412,"Easy-use App and quite a reliable platform with tracking on each payment, each order submission and shipping information. Money will only be released to seller after goods are rec'd and well confirmed by buyer. Coins reward that encourages user to comment so as we users can read others' review before purchases.",1
3413,Mostly pleasant experience except one thing. I cannot zoom out or perhaps pinch outwards to expand the picture or the wordings in the selection screen. This is necessary because especially some pictures or words are really small plus sometimes we need to see the finer details in the picture.,1
3414,Overall I love the whole app and the layout but sometimes when you use the app for too long it will start to lag but thats the only con of this app! Other than that its very easy to navigate and has a clean user surface :),1
3415,"So far so good when I am using the App. Shopee was introduced to me by a colleague who is also a frequent shopper of Shopee. Now, Shopee became my frequent App when I need to buy stuffs online. Purchasing is easy. Customer service is good. However, the description on some Sellers' listing isn't clear, not detail enough and un-understandable. Hope that Shopee can help to clear these with the Sellers. One more thing on the vouchers, which sometimes will get me confused, on where to get...",1
3416,Good online shopping app esp the feature of showing all similar products and have good sellers with competitive pricings. The ratings & response time of sellers are valuable info to determine which seller to buy from. However the app will crash after viewing beyond 35 pages.,1
3417,I had a bad experience with a seller when i first used this platform. So i have stopped using the app for a period of time till about half year ago. Have been happy with my transport vouchers purchases so far.,1
3418,"The only problem is the stability of the app. Many times it fails to load. Other than Lazada, Shopee is a place for very good deals. eBay is no longer the best place for deals as their policies protect the Sellers more than the Buyers. Keep it up Shopee!",1
3419,The app is easy to use. The search function and filters are useful though Top Sales does not always show which seller has been patronised by a lot of buyers. The transactions seem safe and ample protection is given.,1
3420,I like this app. as there are a lot of interesting games. The room for improvement is that there is some minor bugs from times to times. Hope the testing can be more thorough before roll it out to users.,1
3421,"I used Shopee via Shopback app for get the cashback. However, recently, I noticed that shopee is no longer part of the shopback. Am disappointed but overall I wouldn't stop using Shopee itself as most of the price are pretty cheap and received the item from sellers in good condition.",1
3422,Great app with many offers but beware of overseas purchase. Check the review and make sure the price is not too good to be true especially electronic accessories.,1
3423,"You can find some Cheaper stuff her, The interface was easy to use but sometimes it's Very slow to load. had to keep on Force close app and boot it again so that everything refreshes and I can view again",1
3424,Easy to use and charges are clear. Find the wait for verification of bank transfer a bit annoying. Should have selected payment by credit card.,1
3425,The interface took a while to get used to it as compared to the PC version. There's also a lag between the syncing of information between both.,1
3426,"After selecting the item, buyer should be able to enlarge and view the image. This is possible in other ecommerce platforms but not shopee.",1
3427,"The app can be a bit confusing. Hard to find favourited items. Also, I had to search a lot on google to realize that the ShopeePay only exist in the app, not web. :(",1
3428,Quality of goods matched the review and picture advertised. Purchase status and whereabouts can be tracked from the apps and delivery service providers. Had a good shopping experience with Shopee!,1
3429,"Out of 3 purchases, 2 came defective and 1 never show up Refund refute and email for lost items has no further updates. However, over the last few months, shipment has improved a lot with no defects.",1
3430,"Sometimes for no reason, the shopee app logs me out and gives me an error message and i am unable to access my account. However overall experience has been pleasant with sellers.",1
3431,"Found great deals on the app. So far there's no big problems when using the app, just that it's quite slow.",1
3432,"Largely satisfied. Would have rated it 5 stars if the web-based version provides a link to check the ""Like"" items. i can only find it in the app version for smartphones",1
3433,"The Cart. Select All is limited to 20 now. Can it Not be auto selected? OR allow to Unselect All? Cos if we only want 1 or 2 items in cart, we need to manually unselect one by one.",1
3434,"Most of the items that I have bought quality is ok, except a few items being disappointed. Item sent don't tally with the description, sometime size is much more smaller than expected.",1
3435,"After using Shoppee platform , online orders are efficient, any refund, ordering and receiving issues are settled promptly just by calling up Customer Service, only worry is the Credit Card information details stored in system hopefully is fully protected.",1
3436,"So far so good, maybe can increase the reward of games n daily login. I remembered last time is 10 coins on 7th day, now is 7 coins.",1
3437,"Get value times time to time. The most annoying is the games. Aside from that, good shopping app.",1
3438,"search function can be better as compare with other platform. sometime app has slight lag, but discount is comparable with other online shopping platform",1
3439,"Easily can find most item i need, fun games to play yet.can collect coin to offset purchase. I notice the proce is much higher than other ecomm platform. As consumer i normally will do detail comparison before ordering.",1
3440,"it was so helpful to everyone to buy things and other stuff to make it simple,easy and less effort of time.",1
3441,Good apps . Cost lower than others app. High recommend to everyone. Easier to use and can earn free coins for money replacement .,1
3442,App layout is quite messy. Developers tried to squeeze too many things in. But the price is reasonable.,1
3443,Easy to navigate although sometimes it showed there's some error. But the overall experience been pleasurable.,1
3444,"The app has minimal lagging, and the item specifications and other information categories are neatly organized.",1
3445,App works well most of the time. Has some UI issue that needs addressing.,1
3446,Friendly navigation. Downside is the description can be more detail with pictures. Overall still great app to use 👍,1
3447,Works well. Love the games too which we can use to earn coins to exchange for vouchers!,1
3448,"Good overall easy to use and shop, sometimes lagging when checking out but overall experience is great.",1
3449,"everything was good, but the helpline support, I was number 27 in queue when I need help. slightly way too long",1
3450,Pretty good pricing. Delivery is rather slow though. Website is less lagyyyyy now. Hope it stays that way. Tks.,1
3451,"Easy to use, transaction payment smooth. Encounter screen frozen with Flash sales many occasions.",1
3452,"Shopee has improved it's user experience substantially over the years. Right now, it's becoming my go to choice over Qoo10.",1
3453,Great shopping app offering items at good price. However coins too difficult to earn.,1
3454,"Addictive and generally good user experience, but sometimes a little laggy, pictures don't load etc.",1
3455,"Overall a good experience with responsive support via live chat. However, still need some time to familiarise with features & interface as I'm too used to my previous shopping app from another company. As I read the reviews by others, I'm reminded of the problem I encountered frequently - app would hang randomly and I'd to close/open for it to work. This would be my only gripe for now.",1
3456,So far so good. Hope my card info is in safe hand as I have a very bad bad experience with another online platform that withdrew my money in small amount and then went greedy to draw big. Thus bank alerted me. Please do not auto save the card details as it seems. Have a checkbox to allow user to click unsave. Thanks,1
3457,"Easy to use, but have to really search more to look for products.",1
3458,Great for online shopping. Almost all items true to picture. Quick delivery,1
3459,It's getting harder and harder to earn coins. Except for cashback,1
3460,Another good online option. But sometimes the products took very long to arrive.,1
3461,Enjoy browsing shopping. Wish that there will be more more options for plus size dress and office dresses,1
3462,Easy and simple to use online shopping app! Highly recommend.,1
3463,"My 2nd online shopping app that i like,1st online shopping app that i like is qoo10. Hope they gave voucher like qoo10 gave and they have vip,gold,sliver and green membership reward. For those whose buy a lots online shopping get free membership, reward and discount price if purchase. Buy a lots thing from shopee. Hope u could improve in it.So far so good no disappointed about the delivery and order.",1
3464,"my only consent is the app always hang.very slow down loading,it's like I don't have internet connection.but when I try close the app,and open like fb and you tube not problem at all.then I noticed ,the problem is from your app. I hope you do something about it.tq",1
3465,"Yes, so far the price is cheaper then other app like Wish, Laz and Q10.👍",1
3466,"Enjoy browsing through Shopee. So far purchase are relatively good, shipping may take a little longer than usual. They have games that you can earn Shopee coins. Overall, it provide great convenience to online shopping.",1
3467,I will delete my account after receiving refund. Total disappointment. Shopee allows for Bogus sellers who indicate items as available but actually not. Total waste of my time. Now I have to wait for refund. 5 stars? I wouldn't give you half a star. The item is still being displayed as available even after my issue. goes to show that Shopee couldn't care less about it's shoppers experience. Shoppers beware of seller endlesspassion . Deceptive seller. You can contact me if you want to see proof,1
3468,"Wish it had an option to select local or overseas sellers, for easier filtering.",1
3469,Love online shopping experiece with Shopee...searching of products is easy and with wide variety to choose from. Tracking of purchased goods is also easy and shipment information is clear. Will definitely recommend this shopping platform to my relatives and friends!,1
3470,Great app. Easy to use and easier to place order.,1
3471,"Variety of products,easy transaction, fast delivery.",1
3472,Shopping at shopee is easy and straightforward. Price reflected is usually the same minus delivery charge if there is any.,1
3473,"Given 4 stars because there seems to be a bug. After browsing for a while the app seems to be slow in response. And sometimes after launching the app, icons in the app and listing images are huge.",1
3474,Nice app. Fast delivery and good product can find here .thanks,1
3475,Good and easy to use but the shopeepay $ payment security settings no password to secure,1
3476,"Easily purchase, responsive sellers and price are reasonably a..👌",1
3477,Buyer friendly. But search engine is not very easy to use. Not very detailed seller /products information,1
3478,Can only delete 1 item in cart at a time. Please allow select multiple items for deletion.,1
3479,"1) I like shopee because I can use bank transfer to pay instead of using visa (unsafe). 2) I don't like about shopee, the apps took out too much ram space!! (Please look into it.) Other apps like AliExpress, eBay do not take up too much ram when I use. 3) Shopee seller are not good knowledge of their products & size. U are selling motorcycle parts without know the size or models. (U must improve & learn from AliExpress, they list out the models & size to avoid customer from buying the wrong 1",1
3480,"Seller very prompt,and tks for all the hard work at this hard time now .tks",1
3481,Having pleasant experience on Shopee. Love to browse thru the app and find surprise buy.,1
3482,Quite enjoy using this app for online shopping. User friendly.,1
3483,Easy to use. Wide range of products and great discounts. I just noticed that the app slows down when you keep on browsing for a long time. I have to close it and start again.,1
3484,"a very good app to use and parcel not delayed despite the virus outbreak. The only bad thing is that I do not have the choice to choose the delivery time, for the parcel to be delivered to my house and have to reschedule with ninja van again if I am not at home to collect the parcel.",1
3485,The verification code finally work after trying for 5 days.,1
3486,Shopee make shopping easy! Shopee protects buyer from dishonest seller and provide advice readily. Fantastic shopping experience.,1
3487,Great vouchers and easy refund processes. Hope to see more justify shoppe guarantee for shoppers. Tks.,1
3488,laggy. Couldn't go into the rate and to be received page.,1
3489,"Not bad experience so far, but still waiting for an email reply regarding my free welcome gift earphones...",1
3490,So far satisfied with shopee. Timely arrival and in good condition.,1
3491,Good deals but oh so addictive..might need to delete the app for a few weeks..and download it again month end to shop..,1
3492,This is a wonderful shopping app. It is way cheaper than Qoo10 and Wish. Most of its delivery fees are either free or $1. The only down side is that many of the products do not have much reviews.,1
3493,Product received as per described but could be better if shipment was faster...hopefully only during circuit breaker period only.,1
3494,"Super easy to search, find and buy. Good range. When seller not responding, the system automatically cancels order and refunds - so I don't have to go through the pain and suffering of having to get my money back myself.",1
3495,"Generous in giving cashbacks and vouchers. However, app is rather laggy and freezes at times. Text and image scaling can also go off and requires a restart of the app.",1

3498,Nice and simple app for on-line purchases,1

3500,Thank you shopee. I m really satisfied with your deals and affordable prices. All my purchases exceeded my expectations. I hope this will be with all my future purchases.,1
3501,Great online platform. Wide spread of merchants and offer great prices. Delivery fees are usually lower than competitors.,1
3502,The new update is bad. Everything has been zoomed in and doesn't fit my screen anymore. Plus there are alot less deals compared to their earlier days.,1
3503,The most user friendly platform. Easy and simple reward system which i like the most compared to other platforms.,1
3504,Definitely a great platform for online shopping and hope that more varieties to choose from!!,1
3505,"Shopee vs. Lazada = the Same Online Shopping experience. Shopee apps so far Spam Free unlike Lazada. The former tainted its image (once upon a time dominate online shop platform) due to overwhelming spam ""short-URL"" links in cyberspace.",1
3506,Feedback column not user friendly. My 100% satisfied buyers tend to key in wrong feedback rating. Too complicated. Should be improvised. Tks,1
3507,The app works quite smoothly and doesn't seem to be buggy at all. The only comment I have is the floating icons tend to get in the way and are hard to close.,1
3508,The deals are good. But the apps sometimes very lag,1
3509,Easy to use compared to other online apps that i had tried.,1
3510,Awesome...nice app to shop. Still need to improve certain area etc search/ description of products/ more photos & definitely more promos!!,1
3511,If only it goes back to the old times where the free coins are more in daily sign in and lesser coins used to redeem voucher then i will award another star.,1
3512,Generally good experience purchasing via shopee. Recommended!,1
3513,I love shopping in shoppee. But the app is super lag as of late. Always hanging & loading. Can get frustrating. Pls give an update.,1
3514,Reliable but the interface seems loaded with too much information. Need time to get use to the pages,1
3515,Over good experience however i am using samsung a50 to browse the app. Sometimes if i browse too many pages. The app might get abit laggy.,1
3516,Notice that apps getting slower & may get hang after prolong use,1
3517,Most items arrived in good shape. But some are taking too long...,1
3518,A relatively no fuss app for online purchases.,1
3519,Great choices and selection and allows buyer to indicate receipt in accepted condition before payment to seller unlike some other online platforms.,1
3520,Plenty of discounts and campaigns. The shoppee farm is by far the best campaign!,1
3521,A bit slow sometimes.. But overall is good,1
3522,Able to find a large variety of goods (local and overseas) here. The only down side is can only apply 1 discount coupon for each purchase. Unable to use both shop discount and shopee cashback.,1
3523,Some bugs on certain pages e.g. adding to cart sometimes makes the app hang. Otherwise one of the best e-shopping app for SG.,1
3524,Easily get the things I want. Only bad point is some sellers are not responsive.,1
3525,Ordering is easy but delivery is slower than expected.,1
3526,"Currently better prices than Lazada. App however not v stable, and of course shopping cart hangs when vouchers are launched. Also, sale reminders don't work for me.",1
3527,"Great app, lots improved since I first join. Though the lag these days are rather ignoring.",1
3528,"Good, item delivered in good condition.",1
3529,"Just started, so far it's been good in terms of delivery & packaging..",1
3530,Great online shopping tool. Easy to use and responsive to chats.....so far!,1
3531,Good prices but some seller has been offline and super inresponsive. I suggest u remove them if they have been offline for over a month. I took the risk and ordered from one of them 2-3 weeks ago and still havent shipped and i do hope if i cancel i do get back my $200,1
3532,"Not bad, just a little confusing sometimes.",1
3533,App is great but be careful of non authentic items !,1
3534,Excellent service. Prompt delivery despite covid 19 situation.,1
3535,"Apps is great but Seller response use to be very slow. What we need to do was, to contact Shopee Customer service for assistant.",1
3536,Convenient n Safe shopping!! Thank you.,1
3537,Okay.. Good systematic platform. Hopefully items delivery can be faster by d different sellers. Had delays most on my items but ok lah as long they arrive safely.,1
3538,Lag at times. But over all good,1
3539,User's friendly Shopee for me personally. May not be applicable for everybody. I am used to Shopee Ap.,1
3540,Very user friendly. Clear and simple interface.,1
3541,it was abit slow (due to covid 19) but has a very reasonable price,1
3542,"It a good experience using Shopee apps, so far have not experience any issues from delivery side. Will review again in future when start spending higher price products.",1
3543,"Shopee has a decent and much cleaner UI than most products, making it pretty user friendly for customers",1
3544,so far the buyers listed are prompt and helpful,1
3545,I like how creative the games are and everything has been great so far.,1
3546,Great app to buy stuff. Rate 4 star as recently my Shopee coin suddenly went disappear :(,1
3547,Nice and good products and received early...,1
3548,Lag sometimes. But otherwise good,1
3549,It's been a good shopping experiences so far.,1
3550,"Easy for online shopping, many varieties and delivery is faster than most online shopping.",1
3551,Filter function needs improvement. Will be good if similar to Lazada.,1
3552,"Good shop for users, but require more research for some items.",1
3553,"Unable to delete account, always throwing error complete order even there are no pending orders left.",1
3554,Most of the item is cheaper than others. Thanks.,1
3555,Good app that you can get some good deals.,1
3556,Not bad app... But some of the sellers did not give the items that I ordered... There are good and bad about the sellers In this app..,1
3557,Great! Can track your parcels. When you confirm your delivery then release payment. 👍🏻,1
3558,Items are reasonably priced if not very competitive. Good shopping site,1
3559,"Seems that most suppliers on this platform are from China so some products do not have a proper and comprehensive description in English. For the products that I have purchased so far, I am quite happy.",1
3560,Variety is great. Quality and delivery timing varies.,1
3561,Website is nice n easy to buy. Can create Favourite folder list for user? Easier for us to use.,1
3562,Might find some great deals during flash deal,1
3563,Good & prompt Customer Service. Good APP GUI & Product selection.,1
3564,"Not bad but not delivery same day and no pick up point at all, pick up points up to seller not shopee service.",1
3565,Have a good experience with almost all the seller :),1
3566,Good platform to compare prices with other platforms like Qoo10 & Lazada. Shopee usually has the cheapest options!,1
3567,"Too many information, would appreciate if the layout be more simple.",1
3568,Reasonable price and delivery fee.,1
3569,Alternative e shopping platform!,1
3570,Summary: It is better than shopping at the mall nuff said,1
3571,Items is cheap affordable and nice,1
3572,Simple and easy way to shop,1
3573,Fast delivery. But the app at times hangs,1
3574,Easy to use with buyer protection,1
3575,Always my first app to go to for any online shopping.,1
3576,"Good, works with cashback for extra discounts and vochers",1
3577,Some item is good but for chips mostly are broken when received,1
3578,Till now still one of my Trusted platform/ APP to have my online. purchase,1
3579,First time user and I find it easy to use. There is room for improvement,1
3580,"Very impress with the app. I have used a number other shopping apps and there is only one thing that I think would need an improvement. It would be great if there is stronger security feature before the app can be unlock for used. Perhaps face recognition or fingerprint might do the work. I think most people would not have the habit of logging out from the app. So this feature would be good; it would prevent unauthorised usage. Overall, still a great experience in using this app.",1
3581,Been shopping from this app for quite a while and overall quite satisfied.,1
3582,"is there a way to get rid of the buy again display on the Me page? great app, seamless transactions.",1
3583,"Cheap and love all product, only shipping and waiting take time...",1
3584,Good app to buy stuff from!,1
3585,So far so good... many things w reasonable price tags,1
3586,There are some faulty products not refunded but most deals are good,1
3587,Enjoy using the app to do my online shopping. There's various kind of products available,1
3588,Fast and reliable 👍👍,1
3589,Awesome rewards and great choices of products,1
3590,I m able to find what I needed here which I couldn't at other platform. However if we can know whether is local delivery vs overseas will be good for planning.,1
3591,Quite lag at times..,1
3592,There're 2 shopee apps. Install this version for SG users. The other on is for users in Malaysia.,1
3593,Makes shopping easier.,1
3594,Sometimes laggy but overall very well.,1
3595,Great online shopping!,1
3596,Addictive shopping. Argh! But shopee farm keeps crashing exactly at 12 midnight. 😭,1
3597,easy to order and fast service,1
3598,Just type what you want and should be able to find,1
3599,another platform for online shopping.,1
3600,Shopping Time !!! But wait longer to arrived.,1
3601,Value for money with free delivery at times.,1
3602,"Nice App, I Just Hope That Added Other Payment Options Like What qoo10 has. Such as payment to 7-Eleven And PayPal, I know a lot of students who want to buy online items but are limited by not having a Bank Card for Online purchases.",1
3603,Overall easy to use and navigate. What's not positive is the dollar earning system. Lots of long pending dollar earned which doesn't even get credited to the account despite not having any issue. I have spent reasonable amount of purchases via Shoppee but hardly a dollar earned and you can't withdraw the as the min withdrawal is $10.,1
3604,Fantastic way of e-commerce!,1
3605,Easy to use and friendly.,1
3606,Cheap and good buys..,1
3607,Fast service through this seller.,1
3608,"Good app but layout could be better , and the notifications should improve. Sometimes they just randomly shouted shopee which was a bit intimidating to me.",1
3609,App is generally good but must watch out for scam sellers.,1
3610,"Unable to create new account. Edit: It works now, but you guys need a more useful error message because apparently if the username can't be used it wont tell you that, instead the whole registration process fails when you try to submit. This makes it hard for us to determine which field is wrong.",1
3611,Have purchased many good quality items at cheap prices from this app.You have to read the reviews of other buyers to tell you about the item and service of the sellers.I also sell and the app is easy to navigate but it is annoying that I have a hard time categorising my items.It seems like it cannot get into a suitable category and it always end up not getting uploaded into the store. Maybe they can have a guide of what items can fit in a category because some items can be hard to categorise.,1
3612,Easy and convenient to use,1
3613,"Great shopping experience. Can even negotiate on the app 👍 Sellers from all around the world can sell on this platform, making it more versatile than any other platforms available. However , some refinement on the UI can be done, there's space for improvement 😁",1
3614,"Everything is good however just on the parts where many sellers actually dont reply to chats within the app which defeats the purpose of the ""message"" function. Maybe you guys can improvise on the chat system such as to provide benefits when customer buys and ""rate"" the seller instead of just rating the product.",1
3615,Good app to spend your money on when you're bored,1
3616,"My fav shopping app. Prices are better than other platforms. Navigation is speedy despite being feature packed, search results by top sales is useful, image search is great & activities/vouchers during 9.9, 11.11 etc are rewarding! Only lags occasionally.",1
3617,"Easy to use, lots of bargain. Ease of payment can be improved.",1
3618,"It would be much better if u guys start to use ""Rely"" as one of the payment option to garner more customers.",1
3619,"Not bad, but if can add more option for payment thats more easier. Can add in use Paypal thats more great, is more easier. I found out that the review site cant upload the vedio clip. If can upload the vedio clips to show other think will be more better.",1
3620,Great app for shopping but always be sure to compare the prices as even when it says a product has a discount the discount price may really just be the original price also don't rely on the refund or return policy as when I tried to return my product the app said there was an error and customer service didn't nothing to help,1
3621,My experience has been a pleasant one so far. The sellers are more forthcoming and genuine.,1
3622,"User interface a bit messy, love the added feature to earn credits by providing reviews to off-set future purchase.",1
3623,Can get the best deal online shopping platform.,1
3624,"Cheap but good alternative to Amazon, it's not as bad as people say.",1
3625,Great shopping app.. The prices are affordable.. And the quality of items are good so far.. But i hope i can use this to shop in Philippines as well or changing the currency.. I'm here in Singapore i can only use shopee sg unlike other apps that i can change in what country or currency i prefer..,1
3626,I Really Enjoy Online Shopping Using This Shopee Platform.Price Is Relatively Much Cheaper And Affordable Compare To Other Platform.Many Useful Products And Stuffs Can Be Found And Purchase Here.. But The Only Setback I Have Is It Tends To Always Refresh To The Top When Im Scrolling Down To All Products It Have To Offer At Home Page.. Its Kinda Frustrating To Locate Where I Last Browse.. Pls Do Something About This.,1
3627,Awesome app! I've made some great purchases and the sellers/other staff online are very patient but just a little too slow when it comes to dealing with a few damages here and there.,1
3628,Effective. UI needs improvement,1
3629,"Like Shopee games collect coins to save costs for items purchase. But later found dishonest seller changed and increased the prices. Want me close order. Report to Shopee Support, no reply soon gave me anxieties for 1 week (From rating 5, rated to 4). Shopee service Auto Refund and Shopee coins, purchased the product.",1
3630,"Good offer when using with vouchers! But not sellers are equal, some offers good service and products while other do not. Had some bad purchase experience with missing items. The app lags sometimes. No biggie though",1
3631,Good app for online shopping,1
3632,1 thing that can be improved on is when i had to change Ninja Van self collection point due to the one i picked is full or unavailable. The app still shows the old collection point instead of the nee one i chose.,1
3633,Easy to use. The games are quite interesting. You get to use shopper coins to offset part of payment which is definitely good for shoppers.,1
3634,"Great value for money! Made several small value purchases thus far, and was fortunate to make wise choices resulting in cost-savings. So far so good. Delivery services can sometimes be erratic, to say the least. Hence the 4-Stars.",1
3635,"First time purchase the bra pad, very good materials and value for money. 👍👍👍",1
3636,Fuss free experience except the very first time the there was a persistent error on credit card payment during 12.12 sales. Not sure if it was my card's problem or the system was overloaded.,1
3637,Trouble free shopping experience.,1
3638,"Other than not being able to receive a welcome gift because I made a purchase before redeeming (you should change the policy for how you determine your new customers), it is still good app to use.",1
3639,"Generally a good app but have been facing problems, in particular lags, in the in-app games since the latest updates. Also updated my phone OS so not sure what caused the lags. Hope the team can rectify this!",1
3640,Vouchers given are difficult to get. Getting the vouchers doesn't mean you're entitled to the savings / discounts. Must make quick purchasing decisions. Takes time to get familiar with the system.,1
3641,"Its easier for me to just shop online. But you really have to check the material or quality of the product that you purchase :) other than that, everything deliver smoothly based on my experience :)",1
3642,"Isit just me or the app has gotten slower and slower over the past few months. And as of last night after midnight, the Shoppee games link icon has disappeared.",1
3643,"Prices on shopee, after factoring in coins, are generally cheaper than other platforms.",1
3644,"Good app, easy to navigate and deals were great. However, Vouchers were better in the past, hope to see more attractive vouchers soon!",1
3645,Great 👍💰👍 delivery status should update promptly,1
3646,Got a variety of items to scroll thru.,1
3647,Happy shopping however some products not as described and expensive. Some seller cannot exchange items and hope Shopee will advise buyers unreliable or hiatus seller.,1
3648,Quite a slick app. Makes it easy to search and browse but does get a bit slow sometimes when there is high traffic.,1
3649,The app is good but I does not let me use cash at least I think so,1
3650,"Good shopping app. Can go overboard shopping all the good stuff, especially household items. A little buggy at times hence the 4 stars (products page sometimes won't load, but rarely).",1
3651,One more star for further future improvement. Don't be too contented...ok!,1
3652,Some of the items bought looks like the picture and is in a good quality but sometimes the product does not look like the picture so always check the reviews first or ask for a picture of the product,1
3653,"Not bad,only some of e seller doesnt want to be responsable",1
3654,"Very little issues so far with purchase and delivery. Limited items, but no major issues to worry about.",1
3655,Price is always cheaper than others,1
3656,So far so good in the shopping experience,1
3657,Laggy during peak hours,1
3658,very Good. Things are deliverd very quickly. I find it a bit disapointing when i receive the wrong product. Otherwise shopee it really nice to do online shopping.,1
3659,"Actually iam satisfied using shopee apps to buy my stuff, but i have a bit dissapointed about the slow respon of seller and i have one problem. I didnt get my refund yet 😪",1
3660,Many items with free shipping. Many seller to choose from for same items. Able to choose the cheapest one with reviews. Direct chat with seller is good. Do not like shoppe coins have expiry date. Add stress to my shopping experience. Minus 1 star for this.,1
3661,Very laggy. Takes 3 to 5 secs for each page to load,1
3662,"Great ,except the interface need to be more user friendly. Keep it up!",1
3663,Easy app to use for online shopping. Lots of items and variety.,1
3664,It is great to shop in this app !,1
3665,Friendly use.app. but item type not as wide as lazada or qoo10. Still got room for improvement.,1
3666,Most of the app function. But need more security on bank card side. Maybe OTP.,1
3667,Delivery from shopee faster than other platform.,1
3668,Good shopping experience,1
3669,"Shopee very lagging, i just scroll for a while it took a while to get me the next page I love this app so please fix it",1
3670,I have no problems with shopee. So far delivery are prompt. It just the payment system need to be given a choice selection while checking out..on whether paying by credits or debit card. I put in two account but only credit card was accepted.,1
3671,"great platform, and easy to purchase products from.",1
3672,Photos may take sometime to load. Other than that good prices and deals!,1
3673,As far good experience as seller and buyer. Particular happy with the fast collection of seller income.,1
3674,"Overall experience ok, but delivery was very slow by ninja van. Needs to complaint to shoppee customer service in order to speed up delivery.",1
3675,Convenient online shopping if you can be always at home to receive your item. There doesn't seem to have option for pop station collection,1
3676,Generally easy to use. Some lagging occurred when i was trying to key in sone promo codes,1
3677,I like this app. Easy for buying and easy to being sallee also.,1
3678,"good app,prices are cheaper, however some sellers do cancel or never ships the items without notifying unless you check your notification. warranty and refund is good and reliàble",1
3679,Good platform for buying online ....lots of beautiful and interesting stuff.,1
3680,Better user interface compared to Lazada and better prices,1
3681,Good shop when u need one.,1
3682,Great buys so far!,1
3683,A fuss-free online shopping experience,1
3684,"Items found reasonable price, some even cheaper than other sites. To improve Customer service response should be faster.",1
3685,Very good shopping platform,1
3686,Better if can do more accurate searching. And ban exorbitant sellers. Tks,1
3687,Nice app. But feels abit too cluttered at the home page.,1
3688,software more lag after update.. watering game lag loading..even browsing the app also become lagging..,1
3689,it would be great if it accepts gift cards like google gift card,1
3690,Shopee app is working slow at the new updated phone system of Samsung Note 10+,1
3691,Great variety of products.,1
3692,Great e-commence platform. Will hold our money till we confirm received then they will release the money to seller.,1
3693,Great experience so far. Only bugbear is the delivery by Ninjavan. Would be ideal if they actually take note of your request for delivery at certain time frame or inform you a day ahead instead of the morning itself. This would be a win-win arrangement for Ninjavan and buyers.,1
3694,Buying experience is good,1
3695,Apps was good but slowdown on realtime updates during festive sales due to traffic,1
3696,"User interface was good however, out of 4 sellers I buy from, 3 accepted my orders without confirming if they have stock, resulting in order cancelled",1
3697,Easy to use but not many vouchers given to customers.,1
3698,The 'similar product' category doesn't really show the same items that are selected,1
3699,Good app and platform for online purchase.,1
3700,Good place to compare the price but downside is can't see the real quality. But who cares .. to me price is the most important of course subject to each perspective,1
3701,Good experience with sellers so far. Fast shipping.,1
3702,Fast delivery and item in good condition with affordable price,1
3703,very pleasant online shopping platform but description from seller should improve more,1
3704,Generally good shopping experience. Need to be wary of some sellers but shopee take action when aware,1
3705,"Managed to find good, affordable and reliable products in this app 👍",1
3706,"Current issue, unable to find my added favorite by using web explorer.",1
3707,User friendly platform.,1
3708,Can you fix the issue!!! Its down the drain since the last update!!!,1
3709,"Overall good Online shopping platform, responsible and reliable.",1
3710,Overall fast response but sometimes lag on certain pages,1
3711,It's a good shopping platform.,1
3712,So far this is reliable and shipping from overseas usually take a week or about 9 days upon ordering. Only downside is the tracking of the parcel is not accurate.,1
3713,Quite easy to use and make purchases.,1
3714,Could be better if able to states or verify if supplier is selling authentic products for brands stuff. After all enjoyed using shoppee app..,1
3715,good that release of money is done after recipient confirms receipt,1
3716,Friendly user and innovative!,1
3717,Too cluttered sometimes. Definitely room for improvements.,1
3718,Cheap and reasonable price..,1

3721,App is good only issue is that ot does not protect buyer well enough,1
3722,Good and cheaper,1
3723,Great platform. Speedy cash rebate. Good job.,1

3726,Very good and fast.. never crashed so fast..,1
3727,Cheap and nice!!!!,1
3728,Sometimes very very laggy but still my favourite app for online shopping,1
3729,"Will update buyer on the pdt status but hv problems trying to pay via credit card. So hv to use bank transfer. Good thing is, the transaction still go through",1
3730,Only reason for not 5star is because it lets sellers advertise items that they are already out of stock for.,1
3731,Can you add more payment options bacause as a kid it's very hard to find apps that have cash on delivery,1
3732,Wide variety of products at affordable price. Lower than retail shops.,1
3733,I still like to use this online shopping Platform.,1

3735,Good & easy to navigate,1

Especially when the festive seasons are near and you need to buy gifts, I can always turn to Shoppee to browse through the great variety of items to find the value for money items. They are also very quick in responding to issues related to purchase and return. I would recommend Shoppee to friends and buyers",1

3753,Seller very responsive,1

3797,"One of the best online shopping apps there is! Great deals on offers and make purchasing from other countries so much easier. Improvements could be made in terms of 1. App loading speed. The add on specials are causing the app to slow down and lag. 2. Relook shipping costs as at times items costs less than shipping costs. That's said, it's rare to not receive your orders compared to other buying sites.",1
3798,Good app. Easy to use.,1
3799,Good but need back up for change of password,1
3800,"a little laggy, but still one of the best imo. they have a large variety of items coz they linked up with China sellers, and the algo automatically identifies similar things. very easy to use app, but it lags occasionally and there will be an error popping up whenever i click into each listing. Good effort overall. I trust that Shopee can get better and will bet better. thanks for creating such an app and dethroning Qoo10!",1
3801,This is the second mobile phone I bought from Shopee. So far so good.,1
3802,really like this app but recently the app kept hanging when I pressed the cart button. IT PLS FIXED THIS PROBLEM,1
3803,"Although sometimes a little laggy, but overall good app!",1
3804,"Some areas I wish can be done: 1. 1,000 Shopee Coins to be able to be used based per day basis instead of 24hr basis. Kind of silly to have to wait a full 24hrs in order to optimise the use of 1,000 shopee coins. 2. Wish all fake goods sellers (eg. Micro SD cards..) can be removed or blocked so as not to waste buyer's effort to purchase only to realise they are fakes. But overall, still pleased with the online shopping experience. Cheers.",1
3805,I'm 1st timer but cant get the freebie when the freebie even in my cart. Pls advise,1
3806,Just started using the app as a seller & it works alright. One major problem for me would be that the app lowers the quality of my photos and doesn't have a sharpen function for me to adjust it. So my products don't look as good as I want them to. would be great if the Shopee team works on this issue. Cheers~,1
3807,Locals item / merchandise needs to be grouped separately.,1
3808,"All round great app! I get to buy stuff from overseas that are typically not in Singapore, at great deals. It would be better though, if Shopee clamps down on sellers selling counterfeit items. Also, for users to update review several months after to share how the product worked for them in the long term. 😉",1
3809,"Hi, I have been using Shopee for a long time as it is a great shopping app. However, I discovered that I couldn't collect my Daily Shopee coin and couldn't participate on the Shoppe Shake (at 12am time slot)today (I go in to the Shopee Shake on time). Could you help to fix the issue as soon as possible? Thank you.",1
3810,User experience is good. Delivery is great! But the app's design aesthetic can be improved.,1
3811,Everything so far are good but purchase items are a little messy..,1
3812,A bit late for delivery bt overall in good.,1
3813,"a very good shopping platform that i will always use on a daily basis. many cheap deals!! -1 star is because with the recent updates, Shopee very stingy with coins and also lesser vouchers given nowadays. when they give u voucher they increase the min. spending require to use the voucher 🙄",1
3814,Very easy to use..,1
3815,"Definitely a great shopping app in Singapore where we can find affordable items compared to other platform or physical store. The only setback is that the app well crash or lag sometimes. On top of selling items, maybe can consider selling services (similar to Fave/ Eatigo/ etc).",1
3816,"definitely love how cheap and affordable the products listed here and deliveries are fast and secure too! But at times sellers sent out wrong orders but in return you'll either get a full refund or a replacement. Overall, it's a good online shopping app where you could fine bunch of miscellaneous products to your liking at an affordable price 👍🏼",1
3817,it will be a 5 star if not for the fact that anyone can sell on Shopee without stringent verifications of seller & their products.,1
3818,"The layout and feel is like lazada, aliexpress. I like it. In terms of vouchers, they are quite competitive. I have some successful buys there. However there was no option for open dispute feature after you received the items like lazada, aliexpress, wish etc. In a nutshell, hope to see more improvement in customer support feature such as live chat etc..",1
3819,During the cb period..i enjoy shopping online..thanks shoppee for making the things i want in good condition...,1
3820,So far is a good platform to buy items especially on sale with coupons. Customer service is responsive. Though need to keep track of the sale as the auto completion of sale can be a bit of issue when item not received.,1
3821,Great app N more discount stuff.,1
3822,"Generally happy with the low price. However, for the cart items, once we reached the payment page, even we did not click process payment, we cannot go back to change the details, e.g. change of credit card. We have to re-order everything again! Pls consider to improve this area.",1
3823,App sometimes gets laggy,1
3824,Easy to find things..,1
3825,"To summarise, everything is great. Coupons, discounts, UI, all great. Except reviews. Mind giving us more space to write about? There may be customers that only write useless stuff like ""fast delivery, haven't used but looks good"", but there are others like me that want to give others a better idea of what to expect. I've had to add images of my review (written on a notepad) just to provide more criticism. Also, let us edit our reviews any time we want. We might find problems months later.",1
3826,"Good app, easy buy",1
3827,easier to navigate than the competition. i appreciate how items are much more organised and user flow is sensible and predictable. my only gripe is that the one dollar gambling ad keeps popping up every minute.,1
3828,"Great shopping app, best prices in town. Would give 5 stars if the search option is fixed. Can not use search or voucher codes on app. Please fix this.",1
3829,Overall shopping was satisfactory and pleasant except for a few hiccups with afew sellers. Hopefully I dont get another sudden unreasonable cancellation by seller when shopping during flash deals. Glad that shopee reinstated my order in the shortest time. I never give max ratings for services as I always believe there is still room for improvement thus 4 stars. Thank you!,1
3830,Almost everything is available for purchase here! App works fine just that the notifications & chat takes up a lot of memory & needs to be deleted manually one at a time.,1
3831,Good Store app but needs work. Is annoying to see an ad product mistakenly as an actual product from the search. For the ad logo need to be red or orange than Gray colour to let the user/customers know that it's an ad.,1
3832,Good online shopping,1
3833,"easy to use and user-friendly app. but need to work on their customer service/help centre, and also their ""refer a friend"" promo codes",1
3834,Good experience so far.,1
3835,shoppee is a great app to use. the products are affordable although may not be the best quality. I like the shipping details so it gives me an estimated time for items to arrive. It is also easy to compare price for similar products.,1
3836,"Sometime never follow my Instructions, as stated delivery timing MUST 12 to 8pm , But still delivery before that Some even say , cant find location , really disappointed But overall still Not bad Room to improve , Hope to see that - TQ",1
3837,"Pretty nice app but if they could have the delivered option button instead of counting down n needed us to extend the time until then even if we did not receive itme still need to ask for refund. Is abit troublesome, especially when were too busy with Work + Family Life.",1
3838,"Good shopping experience. However, wish the screen text size could be bigger or at least allow user to zoom in. Many times coild not see what the promo details or instructions. Screen can get too crowded too.",1
3839,Price are generally lower compare to others platform,1
3840,"The app has been quite good, always have interesting games to win coins except maybe the timing to play a bit odd for working people.",1
3841,"App is a little messy in its UI design, but other than that it does its job. Just be smart about not buying fake products.",1
3842,Easy to buy things,1
3843,"ita decent but would be better if the tracking for parcels could be clearer. and notification can be divided into promo ads, delivery notices or meassge replies from sellers",1
3844,One of my fave online shopping site. Queries or problems will be handled or solved by efficient team! Great shopping experience for me!,1
3845,I am a frequent user of this apps. Shopee needs to have a strict rules and requirements apply to sellers as to have a smooth transaction for buyers. 1) Seller shouldn't list items that is not in stock and at the end of the day we need to go through the refund process. 2) Encountered many times that seller requested to cancel order as they update the price wrongly. 3) Seller is not being honest to inform if there is no stock partially but still proceed with shipment for the rest of the items.,1
3846,Great app with cheap deals and many discounts. Only issue is i am not sure if the products are real/fake sometimes. Shipping is fast and free.,1
3847,Easy and efficient,1
3848,Overall a good shopping platform. Depending a lot on seller for providing more information on the listed items. Thanks Shopee!,1
3849,Shoppee makes affordable shopping really convenient! There are flaws like inactive/unresponsive sellers and occassional poor quality. But the app is great and the whole service is great!,1
3850,Very good...developer also protect consumers. Can purchase items without worrying money paid and not received product as the app function in the way that money released to seller only when order is received by consumers. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,1
3851,Items are reasonably priced and in good condition. A great app with responsive and trusted sellers.,1
3852,"Have always been a customer from Qoo10. And when i finally tried Shopee, found that there are so many things better wif these. From the non-hassle of navigating, the wide range of variety, prices of items and shipping fees which are mostly at only $1. Just that their delivery are normally quite longer than the average of 5-7 days.",1
3853,User friendly app and easily navigable. It will be great if shopee coins of a much higher value could be given and 2 free spins to be given to each user daily.,1
3854,Great online shopping platform,1
3855,"The app is definitely better (more intuitive) than the web access. It's easier to navigate also more fun, with all the coins to be won",1
3856,Shopping online on shoppee is a breeze. Have varieties to.choose.,1
3857,At times will be lag.,1
3858,"The discount vouchers can be better (value too low), there is still room for improvement.",1
3859,"purchased lots of items in shopee. some useful some not. can be a bargain if u know what u r exactly looking for. others might not be what u expect to be. u can expect wrong items sometimes. overall, good online shopping experience",1
3860,Shopee is an awesome product. The UI can be very confusing and loud though. But I see it's appeal and brand identity.,1
3861,The minimum spending for voucher is much higher now than it use to be. Overall still a more user friendly apps than the rest.,1
3862,"Excellent app, love to buy things from shore. Things up, all the items are affordable.",1
3863,"Overall are good, but i cannot access the bank card and account, it keep showing errors, hope that customer service can take noted.",1
3864,"Can be more user friendly like when deleting notifications, will be better if there are shortcuts or easier way to do so.",1
3865,One of the best deals app.. have good experience with their customer service too.. pretty quick response and helpful!,1
3866,Great place to shop. Log in everyday to collect my coins and use them to offset my purchases. Hassle free and so far good quality products bought from them.,1
3867,Favourite shopping app. Only thing is that the refund/exchange policy could be a whole lot better.,1
3868,Excellent customer service! App is massive n fairly laggy. Products descriptions still yet to improve. Sincere TQ!!,1
3869,"The products are super cheap. That's great. Only that we need to transfer money via atm & not online. I am awaiting 2 more products. I have received 1set in good quality & on the second week after purchase. Only problem is 2 of the items' print is a bit blur. But it's OK, still usable & the rest are perfect. Customer service reply is so slow BTW!",1
3870,A bit slow when app is opening. A great place to shop. Can get daily vouchers n coins to offset purchase.,1
3871,Great app. Easy to use and intuitive. But tend to crash during big sale periods,1
3872,great app to shop but keep getting connection issue when trying to add item in cart even after i uninstall and install the app.,1
3873,Great app to use for buying stuff but do read the reviews first. Some of the sellers items are not authentic.,1
3874,"Shopping wise is good, except the concept of voucher is not good. As even you get the voucher, it subjuct to others people who use it first n it will be considered fully redeemed. Still perfer lazada voucher concept, if you get it ypu own it.",1
3875,Easy to use as compared to other platforms. Sellers are quite reliable too.,1
3876,"Easy to use and order things, I like the item tracking function but hard to remove an item already in the cart",1
3877,app is quite intuitive because the shopee coin rebate will automatically be credited to user upon purchase of item with payment.,1
3878,Very good apps better than lazada. Something to improve on perhaps the return or exchange policy. Lazada is still way better in terms of addressing for exchange return.,1
3879,Good experience. My favourite shopping app now. Although sometimes the delivery partner they use is not so efficient.,1
3880,Happy with the apps. Can save alit of money,1
3881,App experience is good. Brings world market to your doorstep. Good reward system.,1
3882,Quick Delivery Service. Good Job.,1
3883,"the ony best advantagenod shopee is the coins, this seems to be the only online platform that ww could convert the coins to cash.",1
3884,Good site. Great customer's experience and buying rights. Could do well to have price integrity throughout.,1
3885,Lags alot.. Other than that it's really good to use,1
3886,Received the items in good condition.,1
3887,Item arrived early but faulty and now after i charge full the airpods it says 90% charge after first song finished 2 minutes the airpod is fully discharged. Other vendors were good and delivery was prompt . I have one Tap ordered also suffered and got refund. Shoppee help is very good I got back my refunds. But shoppee should stop these bad vendors Subsequently I have good experience especially when getting refund so now I change my perception.,1
3888,User friendly experience and wide range of products to choose from Value for money products Less 1 star as most products do not have detailed product descriptions like other sites like Qoo10,1
3889,App is good and most important is cheaper. Most buyer respond our query very fast and also delivery very fast.,1
3890,Easy and convenient to shop anything you want at a affordable cost.,1
3891,Would appreciate delivery can be faster,1
3892,"Its great and all especially the deals, but it needs to include Locker Alliance!!!",1
3893,Fast customer service response and better than Lazada customer service.,1
3894,Only a negative side is received goods box with dented conditions,1
3895,Made 4 purchases mostly good. But one of the seller messaged me to request for 5 stars for a steamer I received with dented side. Hope shopee have a feedback channel for customers to report seller.,1
3896,So far I been using your app and it is wonderful better than many other shopping website in the world!,1
3897,Price is good but some products do not have much description.,1

3900,Ok. Quite easy to use.,1
3901,Useful to find nick nacks,1
3902,Shipping is inconsistent between sellers some are fast some are slow. Otherwise 5 stars great app to shop!,1
3903,So far so good. Just realise not all seller provides free delivery. This should be indicated clearly in the app for that particular seller,1
3904,"Easy to monitor goods delivery. If can compare other similar products at the same time like previously, it will be even better. After received few products from the same dealer, if press wrongly for Submit button by only fill up 1 item rating, there is no way to fill up the remaining items rating, it makes me missed out a lot of shopee coins.Hope the apps can be improved further.",1
3905,1. I accept the result of email. 2. It is recommended that you do not give contradictory and erroneous replies in the future.,1
3906,Great app but hope you improve package tracking features and your notifs cause sometimes i get lost w the noyifs,1
3907,Easy breeze through while on the bus including 1st time setting up & payment for item.,1
3908,"Further improvement needed, especially concerning credit card discount",1

3920,good reliable shopping experience. would be good to support pre-order sales as well.,1
3921,I was at first weary if Shopee would help resolve the issue with a portable table that came damaged. Glad to know that they were fair to both parties by asking for more evidence from me when vendor claimed that the delivery company should be made responsible instead.,1
3922,Good online shopping experience. Vast variety of goods available on their platform.,1
3923,Great flash deals and lower prices as compared to competitors~,1

3965,So far so good. Only used for 2 months.,1
3966,",i think it is better to inform a time slot when the delivery man is coming to deliver parcel to door stop and the timing of the delivery is not being mentioned .Besides this ,Shopee parcels dosent always come on time unlike Ezbuy .There is always issues with the parcels ,some parcels take over one month to come.In terms of shipping ,Ezbuy does it better. The parcel that took one month to come is ridiculous ,i always feel that buying on Shopee takes more risk than on Ezbuy.",1

Really the worst deliver company i experienced, maybe because they are cheap or paid low for each delivery. They simply just place the item at your door step regardless if anyone is at home to receive. It's due to the delivery company which I place 4 star.",1

4052,I can get many stuff i wan fr Shopee n there r many discount or promo vouchers everyday..hurray:),1
4053,Room for improvement cos I'd encountered scammer. I was told to deal outside the app. Shopee should engaged app detectives. Flush out the lowlife!,1
4054,it's long wait to open the apps.,1
4055,"whatever u can get fr taobao, u can get in shoppee with much better convenient",1

4069,"Good, quick, express.",1
4070,Some of the products are out of stock but they still put there,1
4071,"They will only release the money after I comfirm received my items. After I wrote a feedback, i got back some shopee points. I feel safer to purchase items from shopee. I know after paying I will definitely receive my items. Thank you.",1
4072,If delivery fee can be absorb by shoppee.. that would be great,1
4073,Lag but still very good,1
4074,great shopping experience,1
4075,"Will be good buyer given the rights to cancel purchas before ship out, rather than wait for seller to approve. However, 5 stars for the easy $1 lucky draw which shopee credit back to you even u did not win. Of course, hope can win soon in 2020 ,😘",1

4137,Regular online shopper,1
4138,Good ecommerce store as alternatives to Lazada and Q0010,1
4139,Shopee is just a platform for sellers and buyers. The problems often lies when products were mishandled by the people during shipment and ended with quality compromised which is unfair to buyers and sellers.,1

4158,Seller need to improve their after sales product service especially when buyer received faulty product from seller..seller should either immediately exchange or refund to buyer..not asking buyer to return the faulty product to shopee warehouse which we think is not practical and unacceptable.,1

4176,"Have been with shopee for quite sometimes, very convenient with broad variety of products range however shopee should block counterfeit branded products selling on your platform effectively.",1
4177,Shopee is good. But with limited range of products. Shopee should invite more seller from different industry. And some seller are bad and should be avoided.,1

4318,我觉得在这个地方购物买东西是很好的，为我欣赏的是就是他们送货的速度比较快。可能在一个星期里面也就可以收到，甚至三天也是可能。还有退款的问题，我觉得他们做的也不错。最主要的就是客服服务的时候，你打去的时候他们。说得比较清楚，也比较有礼貌。唯一的不好的就是有些物品，他们卖的太贵了。。所以如果你要买衣服之前，你一定要看多几个卖家才做决定。但是还有有些黑心的商家，他们卖的东西并不是真正那个照片的东西，这个我也是很不满意。也就是说，照片上是这样，他来的时候完全跟照片的不一样。所以就看你们自己了,1

4340,"Shopee is one of the top ecommerce shopping app to use. However, they should have a more stringent process of allowing China sellers to be on the platform. I have encountered many issues with China sellers, either received faulty item or send wrong item. Some are sincere in resolving but some are not., resulting a waste of money. Perhaps there should be a quality check on these sellers?",1

4357,Really love to receive discounts n coupons from shopee. Thumbs up. If postage fee can be charge according to the weight will be fair to both buyers n sellers. Edit Nov 2019: I can see improvement. Not only the cheaper shipping fee for overseas the delivery time hv shorten fr 3-4wks to 1-2wks. Well done. There are still room for improvement eg. Some promo products still not the lowest price,1

4403,"Posted a 1-star review about the app's connectivity issues few hours ago, now the review is gone. Back here to post an updated review, that the app works and I was able to login a few minutes after I posted my last review.",1

4486,Helpful and prompt service till yesterday. I have written to you yesterday on an overdue delivery which I need urgently but no reply as of now unfortunately!,1
4487,The app is good but I does not let me use cash at least I think so,1
4488,App is good only issue is that ot does not protect buyer well enough,1
4489,Ok kaayo 😉,1
4490,Frequently the layout will be very zoomed in that it shows only 1 quarter of the page. Not sure why it happens. Have to close the app a few times before it goes back to normal. Lots of shopping vouchers now for shopee coins. Would be nice to have more actual cash off vouchers than for coins.,1
4491,A bit late for delivery bt overall in good.,1
4492,Shopping online on shoppee is a breeze. Have varieties to.choose.,1
4493,"Great shopping app, items are good and they have a nice insurance in the form of their Shopee Guarantee which ensures you receive your product and in good condition otherwise you can request a refund/return. However, one slight problem with the app is that you have to edit your photos first before you can upload them to your reviews/ratings, which is a bit of a hassle, only ""solution"" is to use in the in app camera feature.",1
4494,The deals are good. But the apps sometimes very lag,1
4495,Good price,1
4496,Happy bless,1
4497,Generally good experience purchasing via shopee. Recommended!,1
4498,"Easy-use App and quite a reliable platform with tracking on each payment, each order submission and shipping information. Money will only be released to seller after goods are rec'd and well confirmed by buyer. Coins reward that encourages user to comment so as we users can read others' review before purchases.",1
4499,really like this app but recently the app kept hanging when I pressed the cart button. IT PLS FIXED THIS PROBLEM,1
4500,Shopping at shopee is easy and straightforward. Price reflected is usually the same minus delivery charge if there is any.,1
4501,good,1
4502,Easy shopping,1
4503,Good deals but oh so addictive..might need to delete the app for a few weeks..and download it again month end to shop..,1
4504,1. I accept the result of email. 2. It is recommended that you do not give contradictory and erroneous replies in the future.,1
4505,"Cheap but good alternative to Amazon, it's not as bad as people say.",1
4506,Very Comfortable!,1
4507,Great app!,1
4508,"Good overall easy to use and shop, sometimes lagging when checking out but overall experience is great.",1
4509,Simple and easy way to shop,1
4510,GOOD APPS,1
4511,I had a bad experience with a seller when i first used this platform. So i have stopped using the app for a period of time till about half year ago. Have been happy with my transport vouchers purchases so far.,1
4512,Good online shopping,1
4513,Addictive shopping. Argh! But shopee farm keeps crashing exactly at 12 midnight. 😭,1
4514,Easy payment,1
4515,Good app that you can get some good deals.,1
4516,So far so good,1
4517,Great online platform. Wide spread of merchants and offer great prices. Delivery fees are usually lower than competitors.,1
4518,Great !You can find most of the stuff & deliver to your doorstep 👍,1
4519,Okay.. Good systematic platform. Hopefully items delivery can be faster by d different sellers. Had delays most on my items but ok lah as long they arrive safely.,1
4520,During the cb period..i enjoy shopping online..thanks shoppee for making the things i want in good condition...,1
4521,The interface took a while to get used to it as compared to the PC version. There's also a lag between the syncing of information between both.,1
4522,Can do better,1
4523,Notice that apps getting slower & may get hang after prolong use,1
4524,Pretty good pricing. Delivery is rather slow though. Website is less lagyyyyy now. Hope it stays that way. Tks.,1
4525,App is great but be careful of non authentic items !,1
4526,"Good app with good deals, from fashion to gadgets to supermart, with every types of items to be found in range locally and overseas. Quite a wide variety of choices at reasonable pricings. It's a good and reliable app. Just that some items may take longer than the stipulated time to arrive due to overseas shipping.",1
4527,User friendly,1
4528,Fast and reliable,1
4529,The verification code finally work after trying for 5 days.,1
4530,Lag at times. But over all good,1
4531,Easy to use and charges are clear. Find the wait for verification of bank transfer a bit annoying. Should have selected payment by credit card.,1
4532,ok ok baby,1
4533,Quite lag at times..,1
4534,Items is cheap affordable and nice,1
4535,"Great app, but can be addictive though. Its a whole new world here, n you need to spend time sussing out the best deals. App actually helps u to save some moolah, if u have the time to play the games, plan the purchases according to the vouchers collected. One star short of full marks is the app lags a lot! Ive a samsung S20+, and the shopee app feels like a 70year old granny. Not good if u want to compete with the likes of Taobao, Lazada etc",1
4536,Can do more buyers when products are not up to mark.,1
4537,"Shopee vs. Lazada = the Same Online Shopping experience. Shopee apps so far Spam Free unlike Lazada. The former tainted its image (once upon a time dominate online shop platform) due to overwhelming spam ""short-URL"" links in cyberspace.",1
4538,"Variety of products,easy transaction, fast delivery.",1
4539,so far the buyers listed are prompt and helpful,1
4540,"I used Shopee via Shopback app for get the cashback. However, recently, I noticed that shopee is no longer part of the shopback. Am disappointed but overall I wouldn't stop using Shopee itself as most of the price are pretty cheap and received the item from sellers in good condition.",1
4541,Has multiple promotions and offers almost daily to enjoy more savings. Occasional slowness in loading pages/cart which gave impression app had hung. Need to exit app and relaunch to continue.,1
4542,Good shopping app with lots of good deals. Still have some fraudulent sellers - my mum bought a toy but got scotch tape instead... Hope Shopee helps to resolve,1
4543,There're 2 shopee apps. Install this version for SG users. The other on is for users in Malaysia.,1
4544,Love the free shipping. Sometimes I just want to get 1 item and shopee is the best place to do so. But sometimes app is buggy and crashes. Have to close the app and reopen again.,1
4545,Good👍,1
4546,Ordering is easy but delivery is slower than expected.,1
4547,Great online shopping!,1
4548,"Easy to use, but have to really search more to look for products.",1
4549,Easy to use with buyer protection,1
4550,Happy,1
4551,"Great, hope to receive more rebates:)",1
4552,So far so good,1
4553,Good,1
4554,Shopee assists in disputes between seller and shopper.,1
4555,👌👌 Good one,1
4556,Made 4 purchases mostly good. But one of the seller messaged me to request for 5 stars for a steamer I received with dented side. Hope shopee have a feedback channel for customers to report seller.,1
4557,"Not bad, just a little confusing sometimes.",1
4558,Great app. Easy to use and easier to place order.,1
4559,User friendly,1
4560,"Good, item delivered in good condition.",1
4561,Convenient n Safe shopping!! Thank you.,1
4562,Easy and simple to use online shopping app! Highly recommend.,1
4563,"Sometimes for no reason, the shopee app logs me out and gives me an error message and i am unable to access my account. However overall experience has been pleasant with sellers.",1
4564,"Wish it had an option to select local or overseas sellers, for easier filtering.",1
4565,Parcel received in good condition,1
4566,"Very good app, bought many things with it. Prices are usually cheaper than Lazada and many shops offer free shipping or coupons to offset shipping fee. App also offers free coins when u give rating/review or other tasks for price deduction during check out. Edit: Shopee coupon lasts only 1 week and some electrical products are much more expensive than official brand's website. Google major brands before making any purchase.",1
4567,Good shopping experience,1
4568,Easy to navigate although sometimes it showed there's some error. But the overall experience been pleasurable.,1
4569,Moving sales & Ease for seller to transfer payment. Recent J&T sega shopee should have kept sellers promptly updated. The category listing team is overdue for an improvement. If incorrect they should send the suggested reco instead of wasting time on the to & fro correction.,1
4570,Delivery delayed..,1
4571,So far satisfied with shopee. Timely arrival and in good condition.,1
4572,Product are good,1
4573,Affordable!!,1
4574,Overall I love the whole app and the layout but sometimes when you use the app for too long it will start to lag but thats the only con of this app! Other than that its very easy to navigate and has a clean user surface :),1
4575,Very good,1
4576,Shopee is just a platform for sellers and buyers. The problems often lies when products were mishandled by the people during shipment and ended with quality compromised which is unfair to buyers and sellers.,1
4577,"Largely satisfied. Would have rated it 5 stars if the web-based version provides a link to check the ""Like"" items. i can only find it in the app version for smartphones",1
4578,"Get value times time to time. The most annoying is the games. Aside from that, good shopping app.",1
4579,another platform for online shopping.,1
4580,"Ok, at least better than Lazada.",1
4581,laggy. Couldn't go into the rate and to be received page.,1
4582,Alternative e shopping platform!,1
4583,Locals item / merchandise needs to be grouped separately.,1
4584,"Out of 3 purchases, 2 came defective and 1 never show up Refund refute and email for lost items has no further updates. However, over the last few months, shipment has improved a lot with no defects.",1
4585,"Not bad but not delivery same day and no pick up point at all, pick up points up to seller not shopee service.",1
4586,"Not bad experience so far, but still waiting for an email reply regarding my free welcome gift earphones...",1
4587,Makes shopping easier.,1
4588,I like this app. as there are a lot of interesting games. The room for improvement is that there is some minor bugs from times to times. Hope the testing can be more thorough before roll it out to users.,1
4589,At times slow to wait for customer service to respond. Otherwise good for now,1
4590,Most of the item is cheaper than others. Thanks.,1
4591,Good apps . Cost lower than others app. High recommend to everyone. Easier to use and can earn free coins for money replacement .,1
4592,App works well most of the time. Has some UI issue that needs addressing.,1
4593,So far so good,1
4594,There will be lags,1
4595,Good and e,1
4596,Easy to use,1
4597,Good online shopping app esp the feature of showing all similar products and have good sellers with competitive pricings. The ratings & response time of sellers are valuable info to determine which seller to buy from. However the app will crash after viewing beyond 35 pages.,1
4598,So far so good,1
4599,Great app with many offers but beware of overseas purchase. Check the review and make sure the price is not too good to be true especially electronic accessories.,1
4600,Good app to buy stuff from!,1
4601,"So far so good, maybe can increase the reward of games n daily login. I remembered last time is 10 coins on 7th day, now is 7 coins.",1
4602,Reliable,1
4603,"So far so good when I am using the App. Shopee was introduced to me by a colleague who is also a frequent shopper of Shopee. Now, Shopee became my frequent App when I need to buy stuffs online. Purchasing is easy. Customer service is good. However, the description on some Sellers' listing isn't clear, not detail enough and un-understandable. Hope that Shopee can help to clear these with the Sellers. One more thing on the vouchers, which sometimes will get me confused, on where to get...",1
4604,A bit slow sometimes.. But overall is good,1
4605,Spent most of the circuit breaker on this online shopping platform. My favorite hobby now.,1
4606,"search function can be better as compare with other platform. sometime app has slight lag, but discount is comparable with other online shopping platform",1
4607,Good experience so far,1
4608,Good,1
4609,Received the items in good condition.,1
4610,Great,1
4611,"Easy to use, transaction payment smooth. Encounter screen frozen with Flash sales many occasions.",1
4612,Shopee has really grow better n better with more local establishment joining.,1
4613,"Found great deals on the app. So far there's no big problems when using the app, just that it's quite slow.",1
4614,A fuss-free online shopping experience,1
4615,"Great user interface design and easy navigation. The in built games are interesting and fun too! Two downside I have had is sellers PM to say item is out of stock but yet item is still out in the listing. Also the other being, if the overseas tracking can allow users to open up the actual web link of the service because there may be times where the tracking services be delayed due to some circumstances in which it is not stated in the app.",1
4616,Having the interaction online with sellers is a great idea!,1
4617,Quality of goods matched the review and picture advertised. Purchase status and whereabouts can be tracked from the apps and delivery service providers. Had a good shopping experience with Shopee!,1
4618,It's a good shopping platform.,1
4619,Mostly pleasant experience except one thing. I cannot zoom out or perhaps pinch outwards to expand the picture or the wordings in the selection screen. This is necessary because especially some pictures or words are really small plus sometimes we need to see the finer details in the picture.,1
4620,Not bad,1
4621,gr8,1
4622,"Seller very prompt,and tks for all the hard work at this hard time now .tks",1
4623,Fast and good,1
4624,Easy to use,1
4625,User friendly,1
4626,"After using Shoppee platform , online orders are efficient, any refund, ordering and receiving issues are settled promptly just by calling up Customer Service, only worry is the Credit Card information details stored in system hopefully is fully protected.",1
4627,Good platform. One star loss due to inconsistent connection and lack of optimization. Functionality wise is fair,1
4628,"Addictive and generally good user experience, but sometimes a little laggy, pictures don't load etc.",1
4629,"The app can be a bit confusing. Hard to find favourited items. Also, I had to search a lot on google to realize that the ShopeePay only exist in the app, not web. :(",1
4630,"Shopee has a decent and much cleaner UI than most products, making it pretty user friendly for customers",1
4631,Easily get the things I want. Only bad point is some sellers are not responsive.,1
4632,Nice and good products and received early...,1
4633,"Good app with good deals. Only downside is there may be sellers who don't understand English, making communication with them extremely difficult. I got around the problem by communicating in Chinese. Good that the app supports Chinese text. Also, many of my items are actually shipped from China. It's like paying less for something not needed in a hurry. Good deals with local stocks are definitely a plus, like my recent purchase of pet product.",1
4634,"You have great sellers, and you have great exposure so there's more choices for consumers, but you need to work on developing the app further, the app experience is still quite buggy, loading from page to page usually crash the app, otherwise I would gladly give a 5 star rating, but you are new, so work on it yeah, I use shopee all the time so I'm rooting for ya!",1
4635,Works well. Love the games too which we can use to earn coins to exchange for vouchers!,1
4636,User friendly platform.,1
4637,Product received as per described but could be better if shipment was faster...hopefully only during circuit breaker period only.,1
4638,Nice app. Fast delivery and good product can find here .thanks,1
4639,Good and easy to use but the shopeepay $ payment security settings no password to secure,1
4640,The app is easy to use. The search function and filters are useful though Top Sales does not always show which seller has been patronised by a lot of buyers. The transactions seem safe and ample protection is given.,1
4641,"After selecting the item, buyer should be able to enlarge and view the image. This is possible in other ecommerce platforms but not shopee.",1
4642,Friendly navigation. Downside is the description can be more detail with pictures. Overall still great app to use 👍,1
4643,"Not bad,only some of e seller doesnt want to be responsable",1
4644,Good shop when u need one.,1
4645,Shopping Time !!! But wait longer to arrived.,1
4646,Good & easy to navigate,1
4647,easy to order and fast service,1
4648,Not bad.,1
4649,Happy with the apps. Can save alit of money,1
4650,Great buys so far!,1
4651,I like shopee to buy online things in Singapore,1
4652,Better user interface compared to Lazada and better prices,1
4653,"it was so helpful to everyone to buy things and other stuff to make it simple,easy and less effort of time.",1
4654,"Cheap and love all product, only shipping and waiting take time...",1
4655,Some item is good but for chips mostly are broken when received,1
4656,So far it has been a pleasant experience.,1
4657,Delivery from shopee faster than other platform.,1
4658,"Easy for online shopping, many varieties and delivery is faster than most online shopping.",1
4659,If only it goes back to the old times where the free coins are more in daily sign in and lesser coins used to redeem voucher then i will award another star.,1
4660,Definitely a great platform for online shopping and hope that more varieties to choose from!!,1
4661,Reliable.,1
4662,Awesome...nice app to shop. Still need to improve certain area etc search/ description of products/ more photos & definitely more promos!!,1
4663,Friendly user and innovative!,1
4664,I m able to find what I needed here which I couldn't at other platform. However if we can know whether is local delivery vs overseas will be good for planning.,1
4665,Good,1
4666,I will delete my account after receiving refund. Total disappointment. Shopee allows for Bogus sellers who indicate items as available but actually not. Total waste of my time. Now I have to wait for refund. 5 stars? I wouldn't give you half a star. The item is still being displayed as available even after my issue. goes to show that Shopee couldn't care less about it's shoppers experience. Shoppers beware of seller endlesspassion . Deceptive seller. You can contact me if you want to see proof,1
4667,"Overall experience ok, but delivery was very slow by ninja van. Needs to complaint to shoppee customer service in order to speed up delivery.",1
4668,Easy to use and friendly.,1
4669,Can get the best deal online shopping platform.,1
4670,Most items arrived in good shape. But some are taking too long...,1
4671,Good,1
4672,Good prices but some seller has been offline and super inresponsive. I suggest u remove them if they have been offline for over a month. I took the risk and ordered from one of them 2-3 weeks ago and still havent shipped and i do hope if i cancel i do get back my $200,1
4673,Its has what i have ordered and has it delivered right on the dot....,1
4674,"Found, bought & received what I need easily & swiftly.",1
4675,Buying experience is good,1
4676,So far so good. Hope my card info is in safe hand as I have a very bad bad experience with another online platform that withdrew my money in small amount and then went greedy to draw big. Thus bank alerted me. Please do not auto save the card details as it seems. Have a checkbox to allow user to click unsave. Thanks,1
4677,Always my first app to go to for any online shopping.,1
4678,So far so good.,1
4679,Fast and good,1
4680,Good,1
4681,Good. Useful,1
4682,App is generally good but must watch out for scam sellers.,1
4683,"Some of seller , asking them to show or guide me their products but they don't answer my questions what l want .",1
4684,Love this app,1
4685,Buy 2 products & so far so good & on time service...keep it up!! Had ordered my contact lens in msia but too bad it was cancelled...,1
4686,Happy shopping online,1
4687,"Given 4 stars because there seems to be a bug. After browsing for a while the app seems to be slow in response. And sometimes after launching the app, icons in the app and listing images are huge.",1
4688,Good,1
4689,Cheaper than qoo10,1
4690,The most user friendly platform. Easy and simple reward system which i like the most compared to other platforms.,1
4691,Good prices,1
4692,Been shopping from this app for quite a while and overall quite satisfied.,1
4693,Still ok,1
4694,Trouble free shopping experience.,1
4695,Fast customer service response and better than Lazada customer service.,1
4696,Good,1
4697,"Good shop for users, but require more research for some items.",1
4698,Good,1
4699,Cheap and reasonable price..,1
4700,Great! Can track your parcels. When you confirm your delivery then release payment. 👍🏻,1
4701,it would be great if it accepts gift cards like google gift card,1
4702,Fast delivery,1
4703,"whatever u can get fr taobao, u can get in shoppee with much better convenient",1
4704,hassle free,1
4705,Could be better if able to states or verify if supplier is selling authentic products for brands stuff. After all enjoyed using shoppee app..,1
4706,So far good!,1
4707,Alot of things going on,1
4708,Great app to buy stuff. Rate 4 star as recently my Shopee coin suddenly went disappear :(,1
4709,Improvement over the years!,1
4710,Easy to find things..,1
4711,Great...!,1
4712,Great choices and selection and allows buyer to indicate receipt in accepted condition before payment to seller unlike some other online platforms.,1
4713,Still a bit lack,1
4714,Easy to use,1
4715,The new update is bad. Everything has been zoomed in and doesn't fit my screen anymore. Plus there are alot less deals compared to their earlier days.,1
4716,Very good,1
4717,Some bugs on certain pages e.g. adding to cart sometimes makes the app hang. Otherwise one of the best e-shopping app for SG.,1
4718,Fantastic way of e-commerce!,1
4719,Got a variety of items to scroll thru.,1
4720,Lagging abit if not 5 star,1
4721,First transaction with Shopee was good.,1
4722,Great 👍💰👍 delivery status should update promptly,1
4723,😀😀😀,1
4724,Easy to use.,1
4725,Easy to use. Wide range of products and great discounts. I just noticed that the app slows down when you keep on browsing for a long time. I have to close it and start again.,1
4726,Variety is great. Quality and delivery timing varies.,1
4727,So far so good... many things w reasonable price tags,1
4728,Prompt service,1
4729,I was at first weary if Shopee would help resolve the issue with a portable table that came damaged. Glad to know that they were fair to both parties by asking for more evidence from me when vendor claimed that the delivery company should be made responsible instead.,1
4730,So far so good,1
4731,"Overall a good experience with responsive support via live chat. However, still need some time to familiarise with features & interface as I'm too used to my previous shopping app from another company. As I read the reviews by others, I'm reminded of the problem I encountered frequently - app would hang randomly and I'd to close/open for it to work. This would be my only gripe for now.",1
4732,Everything so far are good but purchase items are a little messy..,1
4733,One more star for further future improvement. Don't be too contented...ok!,1
4734,it will be a 5 star if not for the fact that anyone can sell on Shopee without stringent verifications of seller & their products.,1
4735,First time customer Ordered 3 items Already received 2 in good conditions with no complaints Thanks Shopee,1
4736,Great,1
4737,Laggy during peak hours,1
4738,Plenty of discounts and campaigns. The shoppee farm is by far the best campaign!,1
4739,Certain seller are co-operative. Item delivert time just nice.,1
4740,Good,1
4741,Great!,1
4742,Good deals,1
4743,My experience has been a pleasant one so far. The sellers are more forthcoming and genuine.,1
4744,Stay Home feeling bored. Hoping to buy fone n iPad at $1.,1
4745,So far so good in the shopping experience,1
4746,Website is nice n easy to buy. Can create Favourite folder list for user? Easier for us to use.,1
4747,Awesome app :),1
4748,Not bad !,1
4749,Fast delivery. No disappointment till now.,1
4750,User friendly experience and wide range of products to choose from Value for money products Less 1 star as most products do not have detailed product descriptions like other sites like Qoo10,1
4751,"Due to the Covid 19, Abit worry about my order from overseas. Good customer service with fast reply email.",1
4752,So far so good.,1
4753,Vendors ship out was fast but take a while to arrive to our home address.,1

4761,Nice shopping apps,1
4762,Very useful 😉,1
4763,The app works quite smoothly and doesn't seem to be buggy at all. The only comment I have is the floating icons tend to get in the way and are hard to close.,1
4764,"It would be much better if u guys start to use ""Rely"" as one of the payment option to garner more customers.",1
4765,"Unable to delete account, always throwing error complete order even there are no pending orders left.",1
4766,Only reason for not 5star is because it lets sellers advertise items that they are already out of stock for.,1
4767,GOOD,1
4768,More diskoun I like it,1
4769,"my only consent is the app always hang.very slow down loading,it's like I don't have internet connection.but when I try close the app,and open like fb and you tube not problem at all.then I noticed ,the problem is from your app. I hope you do something about it.tq",1

4771,Good app to spend your money on when you're bored,1
4772,Good app to shop. Better than Lazada.,1
4773,"Seems that most suppliers on this platform are from China so some products do not have a proper and comprehensive description in English. For the products that I have purchased so far, I am quite happy.",1
4774,Effective. UI needs improvement,1
4775,Filter function needs improvement. Will be good if similar to Lazada.,1

4785,Stuff is cheaper than q10,1
4786,Fast and safe,1
4787,Just type what you want and should be able to find,1
4788,"1) I like shopee because I can use bank transfer to pay instead of using visa (unsafe). 2) I don't like about shopee, the apps took out too much ram space!! (Please look into it.) Other apps like AliExpress, eBay do not take up too much ram when I use. 3) Shopee seller are not good knowledge of their products & size. U are selling motorcycle parts without know the size or models. (U must improve & learn from AliExpress, they list out the models & size to avoid customer from buying the wrong 1",1
4789,Good..,1
4790,Reliable but the interface seems loaded with too much information. Need time to get use to the pages,1
4791,Good,1
4792,A bit tricky. Must practice,1
4793,So far so good,1
4794,"Have always been a customer from Qoo10. And when i finally tried Shopee, found that there are so many things better wif these. From the non-hassle of navigating, the wide range of variety, prices of items and shipping fees which are mostly at only $1. Just that their delivery are normally quite longer than the average of 5-7 days.",1
4795,"Good app but layout could be better , and the notifications should improve. Sometimes they just randomly shouted shopee which was a bit intimidating to me.",1
4796,"Too many information, would appreciate if the layout be more simple.",1
4797,Great,1
4798,Lag but still very good,1
4799,So far so good.....,1
4800,Very convenient,1
4801,Great online shopping tool. Easy to use and responsive to chats.....so far!,1
4802,Items are reasonably priced if not very competitive. Good shopping site,1
4803,Good,1
4804,Good platform to compare prices with other platforms like Qoo10 & Lazada. Shopee usually has the cheapest options!,1
4805,Have a good experience with almost all the seller :),1
4806,Tons of promos and loyalty programs,1
4807,Good place to compare the price but downside is can't see the real quality. But who cares .. to me price is the most important of course subject to each perspective,1
4808,"is there a way to get rid of the buy again display on the Me page? great app, seamless transactions.",1
4809,Fair to both buyer and seller.,1
4810,"Great app, lots improved since I first join. Though the lag these days are rather ignoring.",1
4811,Enjoy using the app to do my online shopping. There's various kind of products available,1
4812,"Super easy to search, find and buy. Good range. When seller not responding, the system automatically cancels order and refunds - so I don't have to go through the pain and suffering of having to get my money back myself.",1
4813,I love shopping in shoppee. But the app is super lag as of late. Always hanging & loading. Can get frustrating. Pls give an update.,1
4814,This is a wonderful shopping app. It is way cheaper than Qoo10 and Wish. Most of its delivery fees are either free or $1. The only down side is that many of the products do not have much reviews.,1
4815,Great variety of products.,1
4816,Good,1
4817,I am a first time user. Still figuring out how to make full use of all the figures,1
4818,Easy to use,1
4819,I can get many stuff i wan fr Shopee n there r many discount or promo vouchers everyday..hurray:),1
4820,"Currently better prices than Lazada. App however not v stable, and of course shopping cart hangs when vouchers are launched. Also, sale reminders don't work for me.",1
4821,Sometimes laggy but overall very well.,1
4822,Fast delivery. But the app at times hangs,1
4823,Easy to use. Worth shopping.,1
4824,Nil,1
4825,Awesome rewards and great choices of products,1

4829,Very user friendly. Clear and simple interface.,1
4830,"Enjoy browsing through Shopee. So far purchase are relatively good, shipping may take a little longer than usual. They have games that you can earn Shopee coins. Overall, it provide great convenience to online shopping.",1
4831,Is good,1
4832,Some items cheaper than q10.,1
4833,"Not bad. Used to be die-hard Qoo10 user, now Shopee",1
4834,Not bad app... But some of the sellers did not give the items that I ordered... There are good and bad about the sellers In this app..,1
4835,Good,1
4836,"First time purchase the bra pad, very good materials and value for money. 👍👍👍",1
4837,"User interface was good however, out of 4 sellers I buy from, 3 accepted my orders without confirming if they have stock, resulting in order cancelled",1
4838,Over good experience however i am using samsung a50 to browse the app. Sometimes if i browse too many pages. The app might get abit laggy.,1
4839,Cheap and nice!!!!,1
4840,Ok. Quite easy to use.,1
4841,Easy to use,1
4842,"Apps is great but Seller response use to be very slow. What we need to do was, to contact Shopee Customer service for assistant.",1
4843,Price is always cheaper than others,1
4844,Able to find a large variety of goods (local and overseas) here. The only down side is can only apply 1 discount coupon for each purchase. Unable to use both shop discount and shopee cashback.,1
4845,cannot arrange delivery time.,1
4846,"Like that price and whether shipping is free are clear before you click in for further details. Dislike that the filter does not seem to work, so giving 4 stars",1
4847,"Actually iam satisfied using shopee apps to buy my stuff, but i have a bit dissapointed about the slow respon of seller and i have one problem. I didnt get my refund yet 😪",1
4848,Very good.,1
4849,Easy and convenient to use,1
4850,"Good, works with cashback for extra discounts and vochers",1
4851,amazing experience so far,1
4852,Feedback column not user friendly. My 100% satisfied buyers tend to key in wrong feedback rating. Too complicated. Should be improvised. Tks,1
4853,A lot of times orders are cancelled by system or merchants.,1
4854,Excellent,1
4855,Good,1
4856,Love ith,1
4857,Hope the Seller can reply ASAP and deliver in 1 weeks time,1
4858,Good,1
4859,"Nice App, I Just Hope That Added Other Payment Options Like What qoo10 has. Such as payment to 7-Eleven And PayPal, I know a lot of students who want to buy online items but are limited by not having a Bank Card for Online purchases.",1
4860,Product is well wraped,1
4861,First time user and I find it easy to use. There is room for improvement,1
4862,Easy to use and safe,1
4863,"It has numerous items and the items are up to date and nice in designs. The prices are also very reasonable and I can always find value for money items. It is a great shopping experience. Especially when the festive seasons are near and you need to buy gifts, I can always turn to Shoppee to browse through the great variety of items to find the value for money items. They are also very quick in responding to issues related to purchase and return. I would recommend Shoppee to friends and buyers",1
4864,Cool,1
4865,"a very good app to use and parcel not delayed despite the virus outbreak. The only bad thing is that I do not have the choice to choose the delivery time, for the parcel to be delivered to my house and have to reschedule with ninja van again if I am not at home to collect the parcel.",1
4866,Seller very responsive,1
4867,Good n fast delivery.,1
4868,"Current issue, unable to find my added favorite by using web explorer.",1
4869,Easy shopping mode.,1
4870,Nice matrial item 👍👍👍👍,1
4871,Good app and platform for online purchase.,1
4872,Better if can do more accurate searching. And ban exorbitant sellers. Tks,1
4873,"My fav shopping app. Prices are better than other platforms. Navigation is speedy despite being feature packed, search results by top sales is useful, image search is great & activities/vouchers during 9.9, 11.11 etc are rewarding! Only lags occasionally.",1
4874,"Prices on shopee, after factoring in coins, are generally cheaper than other platforms.",1
4875,"Shoppee is easy to use, however recently I saw my orders under (to ship) checked with seller, she said shipped, however no update on the movement.. this seller was not very responsive to my message, n I eventually cancelled the order.. then she told me shipped ..",1
4876,Good,1
4877,Will buy again,1
4878,fast service good reputation,1
4879,Very laggy. Takes 3 to 5 secs for each page to load,1
4880,"Very impress with the app. I have used a number other shopping apps and there is only one thing that I think would need an improvement. It would be great if there is stronger security feature before the app can be unlock for used. Perhaps face recognition or fingerprint might do the work. I think most people would not have the habit of logging out from the app. So this feature would be good; it would prevent unauthorised usage. Overall, still a great experience in using this app.",1
4881,another shopping app,1
4882,Gooooooooooood,1
4883,Ok,1
4884,👍👍👍,1
4885,If I win the $1 deal. It's awesome.,1
4886,Impressive,1
4887,Generally good shopping experience. Need to be wary of some sellers but shopee take action when aware,1
4888,Order easy n cheaper,1
4889,Good place to shop for … …,1
4890,Useful and easy to use,1
4891,Shopee app is working slow at the new updated phone system of Samsung Note 10+,1
4892,Reliable,1
4893,Good experience with sellers so far. Fast shipping.,1
4894,GD apps,1
4895,Good,1
4896,"User interface a bit messy, love the added feature to earn credits by providing reviews to off-set future purchase.",1
4897,"Easy to use, lots of bargain. Ease of payment can be improved.",1
4898,Easy and efficient,1
4899,Good deal,1
4900,Good,1
4901,Good!!!!,1
4902,Good for shopping,1
4903,Great,1
4904,software more lag after update.. watering game lag loading..even browsing the app also become lagging..,1
4905,Good service!😁,1
4906,Not allowed to cancel the orders.,1
4907,Cheaper price than other online platform,1
4908,App sometimes gets laggy,1
4909,"Generally a good app but have been facing problems, in particular lags, in the in-app games since the latest updates. Also updated my phone OS so not sure what caused the lags. Hope the team can rectify this!",1
4910,Loved it,1
4911,Good..,1
4912,Easy to use with daily flash deals,1
4913,"Unable to create new account. Edit: It works now, but you guys need a more useful error message because apparently if the username can't be used it wont tell you that, instead the whole registration process fails when you try to submit. This makes it hard for us to determine which field is wrong.",1
4914,Quite a slick app. Makes it easy to search and browse but does get a bit slow sometimes when there is high traffic.,1
4915,Great experience so far. Only bugbear is the delivery by Ninjavan. Would be ideal if they actually take note of your request for delivery at certain time frame or inform you a day ahead instead of the morning itself. This would be a win-win arrangement for Ninjavan and buyers.,1
4916,Simple to use,1
4917,ship out date are changing which means the shops are selling items with no actual stocks count,1
4918,Great,1
4919,I have no problems with shopee. So far delivery are prompt. It just the payment system need to be given a choice selection while checking out..on whether paying by credits or debit card. I put in two account but only credit card was accepted.,1
4920,Price are generally lower compare to others platform,1
4921,Good,1
4922,"The deliveries can be slow and unpredictable as I'm not at home. In addition, there are fakes stuff out there. Overall things are affordable.",1
4923,Vouchers given are difficult to get. Getting the vouchers doesn't mean you're entitled to the savings / discounts. Must make quick purchasing decisions. Takes time to get familiar with the system.,1
4924,Very user friendly. Will be good if can link to other countries shopee for more suppliers who can ship overseas.,1
4925,"Products r fine, goid pricing too. But i would highly suggest that Shopee does not use Ninja van as the delivery couriers. They are terrible and there has been so much trouble n inconvenience caused to customers because of their inefficiency.",1
4926,Very good and fast.. never crashed so fast..,1
4927,So far so good. Only used for 2 months.,1
4928,Good !,1
4929,Good,1
4930,Trustable site but variety is limited,1
4931,As far good experience as seller and buyer. Particular happy with the fast collection of seller income.,1
4932,"Realy enjoy at the app, frenly & easy",1
4933,"Good shopping app. Can go overboard shopping all the good stuff, especially household items. A little buggy at times hence the 4 stars (products page sometimes won't load, but rarely).",1
4934,I still like to use this online shopping Platform.,1
4935,Lots of giveaways and games!,1
4936,Nice and true,1
4937,Easy to use,1
4938,Lags alot.. Other than that it's really good to use,1
4939,Wide variety of products at affordable price. Lower than retail shops.,1
4940,Good,1
4941,"I find that some of the items on shopee are really value for money, but you have to choose wisely. Only issue I have is with the delivery company who deliver the items to the home. Really the worst deliver company i experienced, maybe because they are cheap or paid low for each delivery. They simply just place the item at your door step regardless if anyone is at home to receive. It's due to the delivery company which I place 4 star.",1
4942,Awesome app! I've made some great purchases and the sellers/other staff online are very patient but just a little too slow when it comes to dealing with a few damages here and there.,1
4943,我觉得在这个地方购物买东西是很好的，为我欣赏的是就是他们送货的速度比较快。可能在一个星期里面也就可以收到，甚至三天也是可能。还有退款的问题，我觉得他们做的也不错。最主要的就是客服服务的时候，你打去的时候他们。说得比较清楚，也比较有礼貌。唯一的不好的就是有些物品，他们卖的太贵了。。所以如果你要买衣服之前，你一定要看多几个卖家才做决定。但是还有有些黑心的商家，他们卖的东西并不是真正那个照片的东西，这个我也是很不满意。也就是说，照片上是这样，他来的时候完全跟照片的不一样。所以就看你们自己了,1
4944,A reliable shopping app so far.,1
4945,So far so good,1
4946,Good shopping app,1
4947,I like this app. Easy for buying and easy to being sallee also.,1
4948,Good,1
4949,Great,1
4950,Good,1
4951,Fast and realible,1
4952,Good.,1
4953,"Isit just me or the app has gotten slower and slower over the past few months. And as of last night after midnight, the Shoppee games link icon has disappeared.",1
4954,"Items found reasonable price, some even cheaper than other sites. To improve Customer service response should be faster.",1
4955,So far so good...,1
4956,Nice shopping site,1
4957,Good platform for buying online ....lots of beautiful and interesting stuff.,1
4958,So far so good,1
4959,Cancel orders as requested by seller but no acknowlegement,1
4960,Reliable and fuss free.,1
4961,Good..,1
4962,Generally easy to use. Some lagging occurred when i was trying to key in sone promo codes,1
4963,Good & Easy,1
4964,It's starting to lag,1
4965,"Other than not being able to receive a welcome gift because I made a purchase before redeeming (you should change the policy for how you determine your new customers), it is still good app to use.",1
4966,"Like Shopee games collect coins to save costs for items purchase. But later found dishonest seller changed and increased the prices. Want me close order. Report to Shopee Support, no reply soon gave me anxieties for 1 week (From rating 5, rated to 4). Shopee service Auto Refund and Shopee coins, purchased the product.",1
4967,I Really Enjoy Online Shopping Using This Shopee Platform.Price Is Relatively Much Cheaper And Affordable Compare To Other Platform.Many Useful Products And Stuffs Can Be Found And Purchase Here.. But The Only Setback I Have Is It Tends To Always Refresh To The Top When Im Scrolling Down To All Products It Have To Offer At Home Page.. Its Kinda Frustrating To Locate Where I Last Browse.. Pls Do Something About This.,1
4968,this is my first order....and quite impressed 👍😁,1
4969,Easy to use. The games are quite interesting. You get to use shopper coins to offset part of payment which is definitely good for shoppers.,1
4970,Excellent,1
4971,Great app N more discount stuff.,1
4972,Good for those need budget and safe Online Shopping .😎,1
4973,Enjoyable discounts and perks,1
4974,Too cluttered sometimes. Definitely room for improvements.,1
4975,it's long wait to open the apps.,1
4976,Quite easy to use,1
4977,Overall fast response but sometimes lag on certain pages,1
4978,So far suppliers I had deal with is great.,1
4979,There are few occasions product came damaged or broken. One specific delivery company always seem to have issue on delivering order to doorstep always claim no one in.,1
4980,Good product and good price,1
4981,Can many items here cheaper than other places,1
4982,Good,1
4983,1 thing that can be improved on is when i had to change Ninja Van self collection point due to the one i picked is full or unavailable. The app still shows the old collection point instead of the nee one i chose.,1
4984,"So far, so good 😊",1
4985,Apps was good but slowdown on realtime updates during festive sales due to traffic,1
4986,"Good app, easy to navigate and deals were great. However, Vouchers were better in the past, hope to see more attractive vouchers soon!",1
4987,Good,1
4988,Nice app. But feels abit too cluttered at the home page.,1
4989,look good,1
4990,Great platform. Speedy cash rebate. Good job.,1
4991,Enjoyed the cashback,1
4992,Great e-commence platform. Will hold our money till we confirm received then they will release the money to seller.,1
4993,So far good,1
4994,Item arrived early but faulty and now after i charge full the airpods it says 90% charge after first song finished 2 minutes the airpod is fully discharged. Other vendors were good and delivery was prompt . I have one Tap ordered also suffered and got refund. Shoppee help is very good I got back my refunds. But shoppee should stop these bad vendors Subsequently I have good experience especially when getting refund so now I change my perception.,1
4995,"Will update buyer on the pdt status but hv problems trying to pay via credit card. So hv to use bank transfer. Good thing is, the transaction still go through",1
4996,"Everything is good however just on the parts where many sellers actually dont reply to chats within the app which defeats the purpose of the ""message"" function. Maybe you guys can improvise on the chat system such as to provide benefits when customer buys and ""rate"" the seller instead of just rating the product.",1
4997,Good to shop at a cheap price.,1
4998,Great app for shopping but always be sure to compare the prices as even when it says a product has a discount the discount price may really just be the original price also don't rely on the refund or return policy as when I tried to return my product the app said there was an error and customer service didn't nothing to help,1
4999,Competitive price,1
5000,Is good,1
5001,Photos may take sometime to load. Other than that good prices and deals!,1
5002,Sometimes very very laggy but still my favourite app for online shopping,1
5003,"The layout and feel is like lazada, aliexpress. I like it. In terms of vouchers, they are quite competitive. I have some successful buys there. However there was no option for open dispute feature after you received the items like lazada, aliexpress, wish etc. In a nutshell, hope to see more improvement in customer support feature such as live chat etc..",1
5004,"Will be good buyer given the rights to cancel purchas before ship out, rather than wait for seller to approve. However, 5 stars for the easy $1 lucky draw which shopee credit back to you even u did not win. Of course, hope can win soon in 2020 ,😘",1
5005,Fast service and good quality products,1
5006,Good shopping fast delivery,1
5007,",i think it is better to inform a time slot when the delivery man is coming to deliver parcel to door stop and the timing of the delivery is not being mentioned .Besides this ,Shopee parcels dosent always come on time unlike Ezbuy .There is always issues with the parcels ,some parcels take over one month to come.In terms of shipping ,Ezbuy does it better. The parcel that took one month to come is ridiculous ,i always feel that buying on Shopee takes more risk than on Ezbuy.",1
5008,Good,1
5009,"Overall good Online shopping platform, responsible and reliable.",1
5010,Most of the app function. But need more security on bank card side. Maybe OTP.,1
5011,"Shopee very lagging, i just scroll for a while it took a while to get me the next page I love this app so please fix it",1
5012,"Cant get into shopee shake page, not sure why",1
5013,Need better and clearer reviews on products,1
5014,So far so good,1
5015,"So far my order delivered fast but some of my order always cancel even i ask first if theres a stock,little bit disappointed😢",1
5016,My best shopping platform!,1
5017,Can you add more payment options bacause as a kid it's very hard to find apps that have cash on delivery,1
5018,Can you fix the issue!!! Its down the drain since the last update!!!,1

5034,So far so good,1
5035,Nice app!,1
5036,Good,1
5037,Would appreciate delivery can be faster,1
5038,Fuss free experience except the very first time the there was a persistent error on credit card payment during 12.12 sales. Not sure if it was my card's problem or the system was overloaded.,1
5039,very pleasant online shopping platform but description from seller should improve more,1
5040,"Not bad, but if can add more option for payment thats more easier. Can add in use Paypal thats more great, is more easier. I found out that the review site cant upload the vedio clip. If can upload the vedio clips to show other think will be more better.",1
5041,Wide range of products at good prices,1
5042,A bit disappointed. The watch I bought has no live battery and warranty card was not enclosed.,1
5043,Easy app to use for online shopping. Lots of items and variety.,1
5044,Occasionally satisfy,1
5045,"My purchased product arrived soon, great! However, my free welcome package was not delivered and eventually be cancelled by Shoppe. I asked for compensation but no asnwer at all! Very lousy!",1
5046,"Very little issues so far with purchase and delivery. Limited items, but no major issues to worry about.",1
5047,Very easy to use..,1
5048,Quite easy to use and make purchases.,1
5049,The 'similar product' category doesn't really show the same items that are selected,1
5050,Good,1
5051,Shopee SG it good but the seller delivery sometimes take too long to ship out shopee sure not pushing this matter to the customer who buy online thanks,1
5052,This is the second mobile phone I bought from Shopee. So far so good.,1
5053,Very fast delivary..,1
5054,So far this is reliable and shipping from overseas usually take a week or about 9 days upon ordering. Only downside is the tracking of the parcel is not accurate.,1
5055,Have more varities of products. Need more pictures of products and description of products quality assurance.,1
5056,"Sports shoes, sneakers, boots,down or winter jacket can easily found from here",1
5057,Good,1
5058,"Great value for money! Made several small value purchases thus far, and was fortunate to make wise choices resulting in cost-savings. So far so good. Delivery services can sometimes be erratic, to say the least. Hence the 4-Stars.",1
5059,Go deals on this platform. But bad Ninja Van delivery. Can deliver to wrong block and still update as successful delivery. Obviously never even verify if correct. Fortunately recepient was honest and contacted me to collect my parcel from them.,1
5060,I like to compare prices and this is one of the good ones.,1
5061,Overall a good plarform to do online shopping,1
5062,Enjoyable shopping experience,1
5063,User friendly. No gimmicks.,1
5064,Convenient online shopping if you can be always at home to receive your item. There doesn't seem to have option for pop station collection,1
5065,Good,1
5066,Good buying apps...,1
5067,Competitive prices.,1
5068,"A lot of variety, but must chrck if originl or otherwise for baby bottles etc.",1
5069,Good but need back up for change of password,1
5070,Addicted,1
5071,Not bad as it takes down all my orders,1
5072,Easy to use but not many vouchers given to customers.,1
5073,I'm 1st timer but cant get the freebie when the freebie even in my cart. Pls advise,1
5074,"good app,prices are cheaper, however some sellers do cancel or never ships the items without notifying unless you check your notification. warranty and refund is good and reliàble",1
5075,Is good but hopefully they do something aboit those who sell fake goods,1
5076,"Easy to be use ,maybe add more reward system",1
5077,Many items with free shipping. Many seller to choose from for same items. Able to choose the cheapest one with reviews. Direct chat with seller is good. Do not like shoppe coins have expiry date. Add stress to my shopping experience. Minus 1 star for this.,1
5078,Only a negative side is received goods box with dented conditions,1
5079,Ordering is so easy with Shopee!!,1
5080,If delivery fee can be absorb by shoppee.. that would be great,1
5081,Easy to use,1
5082,Great online shopping platform,1
5083,Some sellers are really good n nice. Keep it up,1
5084,"Great shopping experience. Can even negotiate on the app 👍 Sellers from all around the world can sell on this platform, making it more versatile than any other platforms available. However , some refinement on the UI can be done, there's space for improvement 😁",1
5085,value of money,1
5086,"So far, proves to be ok for online shopping.",1
5087,"Good offer when using with vouchers! But not sellers are equal, some offers good service and products while other do not. Had some bad purchase experience with missing items. The app lags sometimes. No biggie though",1
5088,Some of the items bought looks like the picture and is in a good quality but sometimes the product does not look like the picture so always check the reviews first or ask for a picture of the product,1
5089,Good ecommerce store as alternatives to Lazada and Q0010,1
5090,Overall easy to use and navigate. What's not positive is the dollar earning system. Lots of long pending dollar earned which doesn't even get credited to the account despite not having any issue. I have spent reasonable amount of purchases via Shoppee but hardly a dollar earned and you can't withdraw the as the min withdrawal is $10.,1
5091,So far everything ordered well received.,1
5092,Easy to buy things,1
5093,Good,1
5094,Can find almost anything I wanted,1
5095,Good information good shopping good delivery,1
5096,Easy to use got freebie too!,1
5097,Regular online shopper,1
5098,"Its easier for me to just shop online. But you really have to check the material or quality of the product that you purchase :) other than that, everything deliver smoothly based on my experience :)",1
5099,Like it as convenient,1
5100,Very nice app,1
5101,Fun shopping and good discount,1
5102,The delivery is efficient and the product is very good,1
5103,Good,1
5104,"Good app, easy buy",1
5105,Friendly use.app. but item type not as wide as lazada or qoo10. Still got room for improvement.,1
5106,"Sometime never follow my Instructions, as stated delivery timing MUST 12 to 8pm , But still delivery before that Some even say , cant find location , really disappointed But overall still Not bad Room to improve , Hope to see that - TQ",1
5107,Nice,1
5108,Damn shiok,1
5109,very Good. Things are deliverd very quickly. I find it a bit disapointing when i receive the wrong product. Otherwise shopee it really nice to do online shopping.,1
5110,"great platform, and easy to purchase products from.",1
5111,Delivery was faster than expected. Just that the delivery man don't response to certain query when asked.,1
5112,Nice,1
5113,Price is cheaper compared to other sites. only thing is delivery is long,1

5116,Good,1
5117,Easy to buy things and navigate,1
5118,Like it,1
5119,Easy to used the app.alot of attractive promotion.,1
5120,Have purchased many good quality items at cheap prices from this app.You have to read the reviews of other buyers to tell you about the item and service of the sellers.I also sell and the app is easy to navigate but it is annoying that I have a hard time categorising my items.It seems like it cannot get into a suitable category and it always end up not getting uploaded into the store. Maybe they can have a guide of what items can fit in a category because some items can be hard to categorise.,1
5121,"Shopee is one of the top ecommerce shopping app to use. However, they should have a more stringent process of allowing China sellers to be on the platform. I have encountered many issues with China sellers, either received faulty item or send wrong item. Some are sincere in resolving but some are not., resulting a waste of money. Perhaps there should be a quality check on these sellers?",1
5122,Easy to use.,1
5123,Useful to find nick nacks,1
5124,"Great app, I can find almost what I want",1
5125,"Enjoy shopee shopping, delivery quite fast. Most sellers reply to my queries very promptly. 👍",1

5133,Consider good app at beginning stage.,1
5134,Great shopping app.. The prices are affordable.. And the quality of items are good so far.. But i hope i can use this to shop in Philippines as well or changing the currency.. I'm here in Singapore i can only use shopee sg unlike other apps that i can change in what country or currency i prefer..,1

5161,Good experience. My favourite shopping app now. Although sometimes the delivery partner they use is not so efficient.,1
5162,Loving shopee because there is cashback!!! If only every item has cashback it will be great,1
5163,Still got suppliers not clear on delivery issues like tax or customs clearance.,1
5164,Enjoy buying things fr Shopee... affordable price! But I dislike e delivery services 😥 Got to wait almost a mth.,1
5165,Easy to use as compared to other platforms. Sellers are quite reliable too.,1
5166,Easy to use,1
5167,So far its okay. A 4 rating is given because many times when i place order a refund is given as items are out of stock. It makes me wonder,1
5168,The minimum spending for voucher is much higher now than it use to be. Overall still a more user friendly apps than the rest.,1
5169,Great but sometimes confusing on paying and using vouchers,1
5170,Good and cheap,1
5171,Wish to have more varieties and choices. But overall experience is nice.,1
5172,"More a lot choice than other shopping online, some more cheaper but some olso more expensive",1
5173,Great experience,1
5174,"Good shopping experience. However, wish the screen text size could be bigger or at least allow user to zoom in. Many times coild not see what the promo details or instructions. Screen can get too crowded too.",1
5175,Overall shopping was satisfactory and pleasant except for a few hiccups with afew sellers. Hopefully I dont get another sudden unreasonable cancellation by seller when shopping during flash deals. Glad that shopee reinstated my order in the shortest time. I never give max ratings for services as I always believe there is still room for improvement thus 4 stars. Thank you!,1
5176,One of my fave online shopping site. Queries or problems will be handled or solved by efficient team! Great shopping experience for me!,1
5177,It's an easy breeze to shop on shopee. U can find really good bargain deals.,1
5178,Really love to receive discounts n coupons from shopee. Thumbs up. If postage fee can be charge according to the weight will be fair to both buyers n sellers. Edit Nov 2019: I can see improvement. Not only the cheaper shipping fee for overseas the delivery time hv shorten fr 3-4wks to 1-2wks. Well done. There are still room for improvement eg. Some promo products still not the lowest price,1
5179,Good and delivery was fast,1
5180,Great app. Easy to use and intuitive. But tend to crash during big sale periods,1
5181,"App is a little messy in its UI design, but other than that it does its job. Just be smart about not buying fake products.",1

5184,Fast delivery,1
5185,Nice,1
5186,Good for sales.,1
5187,Ok,1
5188,"Shopping wise is good, except the concept of voucher is not good. As even you get the voucher, it subjuct to others people who use it first n it will be considered fully redeemed. Still perfer lazada voucher concept, if you get it ypu own it.",1
5189,Great,1
5190,Enjoy shopping at shoppe site,1
5191,Better discount than lazada and qoo10. Only thing is the product description need to be more advance like how lazada do,1
5192,Great but lagging at times.,1
5193,Easy and convenient to shop anything you want at a affordable cost.,1
5194,Easy to use app.,1

5217,Price reasonable also fast delivery.,1
5218,Easy shopping and items received as per description,1
5219,"Easy to monitor goods delivery. If can compare other similar products at the same time like previously, it will be even better. After received few products from the same dealer, if press wrongly for Submit button by only fill up 1 item rating, there is no way to fill up the remaining items rating, it makes me missed out a lot of shopee coins.Hope the apps can be improved further.",1
5220,"Excellent app, love to buy things from shore. Things up, all the items are affordable.",1
5221,Highly delightful shopping. 🙂,1
5222,User friendly,1

5230,Great shopping website,1
5231,smooth order and delivered in good condition,1
5232,Very responsive and user friendly.,1
5233,Good Store app but needs work. Is annoying to see an ad product mistakenly as an actual product from the search. For the ad logo need to be red or orange than Gray colour to let the user/customers know that it's an ad.,1
5234,Great deals so far and easy transaction. No bad encounter yet (never i hope),1
5235,Good and reasonably fast delivery,1
5236,Easy & convenient.,1
5237,"The products are super cheap. That's great. Only that we need to transfer money via atm & not online. I am awaiting 2 more products. I have received 1set in good quality & on the second week after purchase. Only problem is 2 of the items' print is a bit blur. But it's OK, still usable & the rest are perfect. Customer service reply is so slow BTW!",1
5238,Very good does not make me worry,1
5239,So far so good,1
5240,Shopee is an awesome product. The UI can be very confusing and loud though. But I see it's appeal and brand identity.,1
5241,Great deals and allows me to shop on the go easily!,1
5242,Great flash deals and lower prices as compared to competitors~,1
5243,Fast shipping and safe shopping,1
5244,It's easy shopping at shopee.. love it.,1
5245,"purchased lots of items in shopee. some useful some not. can be a bargain if u know what u r exactly looking for. others might not be what u expect to be. u can expect wrong items sometimes. overall, good online shopping experience",1
5246,Deliver on time,1
5247,Some sellers are cheaper than other website,1
5248,So far no hiccup,1
5249,Good site,1
5250,OK. for 1st time buying through Shopee. Thank you,1
5251,Great place to shop. Log in everyday to collect my coins and use them to offset my purchases. Hassle free and so far good quality products bought from them.,1
5252,"The discount vouchers can be better (value too low), there is still room for improvement.",1
5253,Wide choice of sellers n products. Not the cheapest but so far so good. Must do your homework b4 purchase.,1
5254,Great to find purchase at such good prices.,1
5255,😍😍😍😍😍,1
5256,nice,1
5257,Favourite shopping app. Only thing is that the refund/exchange policy could be a whole lot better.,1
5258,Basically you can get anything you want.....great place to do online shopping,1
5259,"Good ,shop online.",1
5260,I will continue with Shopee as long it suits my money and item,1
5261,Always a good ecperience so far buying stuff from shopee. Recommended.,1
5262,Good online shopping experience. Vast variety of goods available on their platform.,1
5263,Great plc to get almost anything...,1
5264,Good,1
5265,"$1 big prize only i can't believe, otherwise good.",1
5266,It will be better if the seller can response with 24 hrs.,1
5267,Most of the transaction is fast and reliable..,1
5268,Good services,1
5269,"Easy to use and order things, I like the item tracking function but hard to remove an item already in the cart",1
5270,"Further improvement needed, especially concerning credit card discount",1
5271,Very good...developer also protect consumers. Can purchase items without worrying money paid and not received product as the app function in the way that money released to seller only when order is received by consumers. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,1
5272,"Wide range of items, delivery is fast.",1
5273,Good apps,1
5274,So far so good. Just realise not all seller provides free delivery. This should be indicated clearly in the app for that particular seller,1
5275,Satisfied with most of my purchases thru shopee. Using ningja van as delivery company is a good choice.,1
5276,Good.,1
5277,Easy to use and orders are fulfil promptly. Like the feeling of getting my orders fast. 👍😊,1
5278,A bit slow when app is opening. A great place to shop. Can get daily vouchers n coins to offset purchase.,1
5279,Good,1
5280,Good. Prompt delivery usually earlier than specified. Great.,1
5281,"Love shopee delivery, they will call n make sure u not at home n give them a code to confirm.",1
5282,Good apps and enjoy online shopping here!,1
5283,Great app to use for buying stuff but do read the reviews first. Some of the sellers items are not authentic.,1
5284,👍 💯💝,1
5285,Quite good buys here. Only the coupon is abit irrelevant at times.,1
5286,more promo code,1
5287,Most of the sellers are fast react to orders but still have a few take his own sweet time.,1
5288,"Generally happy with the low price. However, for the cart items, once we reached the payment page, even we did not click process payment, we cannot go back to change the details, e.g. change of credit card. We have to re-order everything again! Pls consider to improve this area.",1
5289,There are some seller that don't respond promptly.,1
5290,"Most of my experience is great and Shopee is usually my go to online store. Just be sure to read reviews and when receiving the bought items, give reviews. This will help both sellers and buyers in being responsible.",1
5291,Shipping is inconsistent between sellers some are fast some are slow. Otherwise 5 stars great app to shop!,1
5292,Cool.,1
5293,Payment always got problem w card.now can only pay by tra .,1
5294,App is good and most important is cheaper. Most buyer respond our query very fast and also delivery very fast.,1
5295,great shopping experience,1
5296,"Easy to find products and protect customers from irresponsible sellers. However , some functions eg change payment need to improve.",1
5297,"So far service are good, keep it up.",1
5298,Good transection,1
5299,Great,1
5300,Room for improvement cos I'd encountered scammer. I was told to deal outside the app. Shopee should engaged app detectives. Flush out the lowlife!,1
5301,Ok,1
5302,Good,1
5303,"Some areas I wish can be done: 1. 1,000 Shopee Coins to be able to be used based per day basis instead of 24hr basis. Kind of silly to have to wait a full 24hrs in order to optimise the use of 1,000 shopee coins. 2. Wish all fake goods sellers (eg. Micro SD cards..) can be removed or blocked so as not to waste buyer's effort to purchase only to realise they are fakes. But overall, still pleased with the online shopping experience. Cheers.",1
5304,Shoppee makes affordable shopping really convenient! There are flaws like inactive/unresponsive sellers and occassional poor quality. But the app is great and the whole service is great!,1
5305,Okay,1
5306,Item cheaper than other app. Some item can get free delivery😍.,1
5307,Most of the items delivered as advertised. Some items are cheap too!,1
5308,"Best online shop at tke time moment, I buy fm Q10 to lazada n now shoppee cos shoppee give best offer now I like the most is the cashback thank keep it up.",1
5309,Good,1
5310,Some item cheaper than other apps 👍,1
5311,"To summarise, everything is great. Coupons, discounts, UI, all great. Except reviews. Mind giving us more space to write about? There may be customers that only write useless stuff like ""fast delivery, haven't used but looks good"", but there are others like me that want to give others a better idea of what to expect. I've had to add images of my review (written on a notepad) just to provide more criticism. Also, let us edit our reviews any time we want. We might find problems months later.",1
5312,Should improve snap search.,1
5313,So far is a good platform to buy items especially on sale with coupons. Customer service is responsive. Though need to keep track of the sale as the auto completion of sale can be a bit of issue when item not received.,1
5314,Good . Keep it out. Sometime coin didnt get in.,1
5315,Good,1
5316,"Although at times met with some unscrupulous sellers, but overall Shopee make my shopping experience wonderful.",1
5317,Almost everything is available for purchase here! App works fine just that the notifications & chat takes up a lot of memory & needs to be deleted manually one at a time.,1
5318,Easy to use. Just that voucher cannot stack.,1
5319,Very good apps better than lazada. Something to improve on perhaps the return or exchange policy. Lazada is still way better in terms of addressing for exchange return.,1
5320,ok but what about landscape mode on android tablet,1
5321,Smooth transaction and delivery most of the time... My orders received as per described...,1
5322,"The app has been quite good, always have interesting games to win coins except maybe the timing to play a bit odd for working people.",1
5323,good,1
5324,"Its great and all especially the deals, but it needs to include Locker Alliance!!!",1
5325,Resonable price**,1
5326,"Pretty nice app but if they could have the delivered option button instead of counting down n needed us to extend the time until then even if we did not receive itme still need to ask for refund. Is abit troublesome, especially when were too busy with Work + Family Life.",1
5327,Many great deals & discount. Customer support is great.,1
5328,Easy to use. Rarely breakdown/hang.,1
5329,Met very responsive and nice sellers who will answer to my queries. App is user friendly.,1
5330,I love it,1
5331,Definitely able to find some stuffs cheaper than the other apps,1
5332,Seller need to improve their after sales product service especially when buyer received faulty product from seller..seller should either immediately exchange or refund to buyer..not asking buyer to return the faulty product to shopee warehouse which we think is not practical and unacceptable.,1
5333,"Good, quick, express.",1
5334,nice online platform but item and description could be more improved like taobao or lazada.,1
5335,Easy breeze through while on the bus including 1st time setting up & payment for item.,1
5336,It gives me happiness whenever I order something,1
5337,"Can be more user friendly like when deleting notifications, will be better if there are shortcuts or easier way to do so.",1
5338,Easy to use,1
5339,How to put shipping from overseas... I dont understand abt the shipping...,1
5340,Good,1
5341,"Certain things are cheaper than LZ and Q, but there are also sellers selling faked products. Must read the reviews before making any purchase. Please report counterfeits to Shopee.sg as I believe they will take action.",1
5342,Love the $1 draw. A very good online shopping app.,1
5343,"Overall are good, but i cannot access the bank card and account, it keep showing errors, hope that customer service can take noted.",1
5344,"Hi, I have been using Shopee for a long time as it is a great shopping app. However, I discovered that I couldn't collect my Daily Shopee coin and couldn't participate on the Shoppe Shake (at 12am time slot)today (I go in to the Shopee Shake on time). Could you help to fix the issue as soon as possible? Thank you.",1
5345,Good,1
5346,shoppee is a great app to use. the products are affordable although may not be the best quality. I like the shipping details so it gives me an estimated time for items to arrive. It is also easy to compare price for similar products.,1
5347,good,1
5348,easier to navigate than the competition. i appreciate how items are much more organised and user flow is sensible and predictable. my only gripe is that the one dollar gambling ad keeps popping up every minute.,1
5349,"j,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,辷赱f<…!…………-…}Y—.…8##88 / \丶… - h\\—:…Y`///\……/ …",1
5350,Shopee App is user friendly.,1
5351,Good,1
5352,can you change it to PESO₱?,1
5353,Works a lot better than the mobile website.,1
5354,Good site. Great customer's experience and buying rights. Could do well to have price integrity throughout.,1
5355,"definitely love how cheap and affordable the products listed here and deliveries are fast and secure too! But at times sellers sent out wrong orders but in return you'll either get a full refund or a replacement. Overall, it's a good online shopping app where you could fine bunch of miscellaneous products to your liking at an affordable price 👍🏼",1
5356,Great app but hope you improve package tracking features and your notifs cause sometimes i get lost w the noyifs,1
5357,Excellent customer service! App is massive n fairly laggy. Products descriptions still yet to improve. Sincere TQ!!,1
5358,Friends unable to use my referral code,1
5359,"easy to use and user-friendly app. but need to work on their customer service/help centre, and also their ""refer a friend"" promo codes",1
5360,interesting apps easily to use,1
5361,An online shopping apps for some bargain.,1
5362,very easy and convenient shopping 👍👍👍,1
5363,Great app with cheap deals and many discounts. Only issue is i am not sure if the products are real/fake sometimes. Shipping is fast and free.,1
5364,no 1 shopping app in Singapore,1
5365,One of the best deals app.. have good experience with their customer service too.. pretty quick response and helpful!,1
5366,I like the notification feature when my liked item is on discount.,1
5367,"One of the best online shopping apps there is! Great deals on offers and make purchasing from other countries so much easier. Improvements could be made in terms of 1. App loading speed. The add on specials are causing the app to slow down and lag. 2. Relook shipping costs as at times items costs less than shipping costs. That's said, it's rare to not receive your orders compared to other buying sites.",1
5368,"Have been with shopee for quite sometimes, very convenient with broad variety of products range however shopee should block counterfeit branded products selling on your platform effectively.",1
5369,Shopee is a nice e-commerce online shopping to shop. just one point need to point out if it has a remark session to inform the delivery what to expect will be great.,1
5370,Shopee is good. But with limited range of products. Shopee should invite more seller from different industry. And some seller are bad and should be avoided.,1
5371,"replied decently fast when i had queries. while it wasn't very fast, the answers were definite and clear to the questions i had.",1
5372,"Like Shopee because prices are more competitive than similar items on other on-line platforms. However, wait time for refund for Return/ Return is not as fast as Lazada.",1
5373,Some delivery exceeded extended guarantee time should be auto cancelled. Some waits are too long.,1
5374,"Easy to use with wide variety of products. Goods are generally cheaper than outside shops, especially with daily voucher rebate.",1
5375,"All round great app! I get to buy stuff from overseas that are typically not in Singapore, at great deals. It would be better though, if Shopee clamps down on sellers selling counterfeit items. Also, for users to update review several months after to share how the product worked for them in the long term. 😉",1
5376,Would like to see more relevant introduction of products,1
5377,"the ony best advantagenod shopee is the coins, this seems to be the only online platform that ww could convert the coins to cash.",1
5378,"Products detail, photo and delivery duration need to improve. Some did not specify clearly and photo if in 3D will be better as sometime we can't the other side of the product. Delivery sometimes took months and in the end suppliers said out of stock.",1
5379,"Good n friendly app. Only the vendor need to be educate on their PR,otherwise this app is better than the current one as it has low shipping cost,which another pulling factor.",1
5380,"ita decent but would be better if the tracking for parcels could be clearer. and notification can be divided into promo ads, delivery notices or meassge replies from sellers",1
5381,"a little laggy, but still one of the best imo. they have a large variety of items coz they linked up with China sellers, and the algo automatically identifies similar things. very easy to use app, but it lags occasionally and there will be an error popping up whenever i click into each listing. Good effort overall. I trust that Shopee can get better and will bet better. thanks for creating such an app and dethroning Qoo10!",1
5382,great app to shop but keep getting connection issue when trying to add item in cart even after i uninstall and install the app.,1
5383,app is quite intuitive because the shopee coin rebate will automatically be credited to user upon purchase of item with payment.,1
5384,Overall a good shopping platform. Depending a lot on seller for providing more information on the listed items. Thanks Shopee!,1
5385,good reliable shopping experience. would be good to support pre-order sales as well.,1
5386,"Great shopping app, best prices in town. Would give 5 stars if the search option is fixed. Can not use search or voucher codes on app. Please fix this.",1
5387,"good for discounts, but need a better search algorithm",1
5388,User friendly app and easily navigable. It will be great if shopee coins of a much higher value could be given and 2 free spins to be given to each user daily.,1
5389,need to be more organised,1
5390,i like the quiz and more spins given in shopee~ it's fun! ^^,1
5391,"Just started using Shopee and have good experiences so far. The sellers are quite responsive and my orders were sent on the same day. Not sure if there is option to choose delivery type (i.e. courier vs snail mail), but it will be good to have that option.",1
5392,"Definitely a great shopping app in Singapore where we can find affordable items compared to other platform or physical store. The only setback is that the app well crash or lag sometimes. On top of selling items, maybe can consider selling services (similar to Fave/ Eatigo/ etc).",1
5393,Pls make PayPal as a payment method,1
5394,easy to use application,1
5395,"a very good shopping platform that i will always use on a daily basis. many cheap deals!! -1 star is because with the recent updates, Shopee very stingy with coins and also lesser vouchers given nowadays. when they give u voucher they increase the min. spending require to use the voucher 🙄",1
5396,first time bought item . received very good condition and item is correct and very fast.,1
5397,Conducive to use.,1
5398,the search filter is not extensive,1
5399,"Its a dangerously addictive shopaholic app. Be sure to check the seller last online status and rating, as some seems to have trust issues.",1
5400,I am a frequent user of this apps. Shopee needs to have a strict rules and requirements apply to sellers as to have a smooth transaction for buyers. 1) Seller shouldn't list items that is not in stock and at the end of the day we need to go through the refund process. 2) Encountered many times that seller requested to cancel order as they update the price wrongly. 3) Seller is not being honest to inform if there is no stock partially but still proceed with shipment for the rest of the items.,1
5401,good,1
5402,Just started using the app as a seller & it works alright. One major problem for me would be that the app lowers the quality of my photos and doesn't have a sharpen function for me to adjust it. So my products don't look as good as I want them to. would be great if the Shopee team works on this issue. Cheers~,1
5403,offers good deals but i hope that they remove sellers who sell fake items..,1
5404,Downloading the app was easy. Not much info and stuff to fill up. The app make cash top up and buying transaction easy. There are lots of awesome deals everyday. The prices are competitive but many are reasonable. Always looking for the best deals at the best affordable price. There are also cashback and coins to win. There are many games that I can play and at the same win coins too. The games are fun and of a few variety. The daily and weekly $1 deal is always something I will look forward to.,1
5405,"Shopping that comes with some fun games to play with. Much as I like to use the mobile app to be able to shop and play anywhere and/or anytime, shopping and playing via the desktop is still by far better as the screen and fonts are bigger and the layout is more is easier to see. Hope Shopee will make all features and functions that are on the mobile available on the desktop as well.",1
5406,"It's a good app for online shopping, but you have the games for us to earn the shoppee coin. Which I played and played but I couldn't claim the coin. For example, the shoppee dance. I dance perfectly and got a perfect score. But the whole thing went blank and I couldn't claim the coin as well as I lost the chance.",1
5407,"I'm happy having this! Those things i need are and very affordable, it's so easy to use and very convenient like me as a working mum that got no enough time for shopping.

5408,The go to app whenever I want to purchase things! Price is rather competitive to other app. Usually their price is reasonable and lowest among all. Very reliable and trustable app. Easy to use too! One thing I like is that they provide door step delivery at low cost. Unlike other app which u have to pay for delivery to your door step.,1
5409,"Almost everything you can find in Singapore, you can find it here. More major household brands are jumping on this online platform. The apps is intuitive and easy to search. The discount voucher promotion among different categories of goods could be difficult to mix and match. Overall, it helps you to shop online during a Circuit Breaker in Singapore.",1

5413,"Deals can be cheaper than those on the official website (even though its the same company selling it- the original one). Together with shop coupons, shopee cashbacks and using shopback for some more cashbacks, the savings are tremendous!!! Plus u can check the ratings to check on the quality of products bought.",1
5414,"When you shop at Shopee you will be notify first when you can receive your goods, therefor you can make your decision before purchasing. There are many items sell at Shopee, you name it, and the prices are mostly affordable. The products are of good quality, most of it. I love to shop at Shopee😊😍",1
5415,"So far so good :) enjoying my time scrolling through and seeing the great prices. Loved that there's a bank transfer option, as I usually can't shop online due to having no credit card.

5421,"Well designed app. However, i have been receiving many notifications. So far, I'm unable to find anywhere in the app to selectively turn-off the unnecessary notifications.",1
5422,Shopping with Shopee had been easy and a joy. Only gripe had been the tracking of product. It could have been more transparent - too general. Anyway a job well done and thank you Shopee.,1
5423,Very nice app for shopping! Items are relatively much cheaper than retail. Easy and smooth platform for both buyers and sellers. So happy to chance upon Shopee!,1
5424,Products are generally between reasonable to good quality. The greatest perk of shopping on this app would be the price of their products which is definitely healthy for the wallet. Will continue to purchase via this app.,1
5425,Smooth apps to use. I would recommend new users to try and experience it yourself. User friendly and it is really a great Apps to use. I'm very happy w/ Shopee's Application and User experience. Thanks Shopee (: Stay safe Everyone. And have a great day! ^^ .,1

5439,I'm relatively new to Shopee (10+ purchases only). So far it's been a good shopping experience. I haven't had problems to require refunds but I hope it will be as buyer friendly as AliExpress which I have made 1000+ purchases. Three improvements needed: 1. The tabs to each games would be more direct. Currently you need to go through 2-3 levels just to play them. 2. I wish there's a search 'similar ' image tab. 3. Filter features are very sluggish and messy.,1
5440,"Got kicked out from the app, have to log in again but still buffering. Error messages keeps popping up. What's going on?",1
